# Awakened Mechanic and Daphine Item: Final Implementation Summary


## 1. Overview and Goals

- **Purpose:** Add a new "Awakened" enhancement layer to characters, distinct from stars, shards, or bond.
- **Mechanic:** Characters can be awakened by consuming a special item called "Daphine".
- **Acquisition:** Daphine is a special item tracked as an integer on the user record (not currently purchasable in shop; only admin/test grant for now).
- **UI/UX:** Users can see which characters are awakened in all main collection/profile displays, and can awaken eligible characters via a dedicated command.

---

## 2. Data Model Changes

### 2.1. Waifu/Character Data
- Add a new boolean field to each waifu/character instance: `is_awakened` (default: False).
- **Where:** In the userâ€™s waifu/character collection table/document (e.g., `user_waifus`, `waifu_collection`, etc).

### 2.2. Inventory
- Add Daphine item to the user inventory schema:
  - If inventory is a key-value map, add `"daphine": <int>` to represent the count.
  - If inventory is a relational table, add a row for Daphine with the userâ€™s count.

---

## 3. Database Layer Changes

### 3.1. Waifu/Character Table
- **Schema Migration:** Add `is_awakened` (bool) column/field to the waifu table/collection.
- **CRUD Operations:** Update insert and update logic to handle the new field. Ensure waifu retrieval includes the awakened field.

### 3.2. Inventory Table
- **Schema:** Ensure the inventory can store Daphine (add to item master list if needed).
- **CRUD Operations:** Update inventory add/remove logic to support Daphine. Ensure inventory retrieval includes Daphine.

### 3.3. Shop Table
- **Schema:** Add Daphine to the shop items table/config with price, description, and purchase limits.

---

## 4. Service Layer Changes

### 4.1. Waifu Service
- **Awaken Logic:**
  - Add a method to awaken a waifu:
    - Check if waifu is owned and not already awakened.
    - Check if user has at least 1 Daphine.
    - Deduct Daphine, set waifuâ€™s `is_awakened` to True, and persist changes.
- **Waifu Retrieval:** Ensure all waifu retrieval methods include the awakened field.

### 4.2. Inventory Service
- **Daphine Management:** Add methods to add, remove, and check Daphine count. Update purchase logic to add Daphine to inventory.

### 4.3. Shop Service
- **Daphine Purchase:** Add Daphine to the shopâ€™s available items. Ensure purchase logic deducts currency and adds Daphine to inventory.

---


## 5. Command/UI Layer

- **/nwnl_awaken**: Command to awaken a waifu. Prompts for waifu selection, checks Daphine, confirms, and updates state. Confirmation embed shows the awakened waifu.
- **/nwnl_status**: Now displays the user's Daphine count.
- **/nwnl_profile**: Shows awakened status for the waifu (badge/field in embed).
- **/nwnl_collection**: Shows the number of awakened waifus in the user's collection.
- **/nwnl_collection_list**: Shows a ðŸ¦‹ badge next to each awakened waifu's name in the paginated list.

---


## 6. Display and Effects

- Awakened status is shown in all main waifu info displays:
  - **/nwnl_profile**: Awakened badge/field in the profile embed.
  - **/nwnl_collection**: Awakened count field.
  - **/nwnl_collection_list**: ðŸ¦‹ badge next to awakened waifu names.
  - **/nwnl_status**: Daphine count shown.
- Visual: ðŸ¦‹ badge is used for awakened status in lists and profiles.

---

## 7. Persistence

- Update user waifu storage to persist the awakened state.
- Update inventory storage to persist Daphine count.

---


## 8. Testing and Edge Cases

- Tested: Awakening a waifu, Daphine deduction, UI updates for all main commands.
- Edge cases handled: already awakened, no Daphine, trying to awaken non-owned waifu.

## 10. Example: Database/Service Layer Pseudocode

### 10.1. Database Table Example

**user_waifus Table:**
| id | user_id | waifu_id | ... | is_awakened (bool) |
|----|---------|----------|-----|--------------------|
| 1  | 123     | 456      | ... | False              |

**user_inventory Table:**
| id | user_id | item_name | count |
|----|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1  | 123     | daphine   | 2     |

### 10.2. Service Layer Example

```python
# WaifuService
async def awaken_waifu(self, user_id, waifu_id):
    waifu = await self.get_user_waifu(user_id, waifu_id)
    if waifu.is_awakened:
        raise Exception("Already awakened")
    if not await self.inventory_service.has_item(user_id, "daphine", 1):
        raise Exception("Not enough Daphine")
    await self.inventory_service.remove_item(user_id, "daphine", 1)
    waifu.is_awakened = True
    await self.save_user_waifu(waifu)
```

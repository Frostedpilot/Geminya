- **Automatic**: Shard collection and instant upgrades on duplicate pulls
- **Pity System**: 90-pull 3★ guarantee, 10-pull 2★ guarantee

## ⚠️ Files Still Using Old 5★ System:

### 1. **Documentation Files** (Non-Critical)
- `WAIFU_SETUP.md` - Contains old 5★ gacha rates documentation
- `docs/WAIFU.md` - References old pity system
- **Impact**: Documentation only, doesn't affect functionality

### 2. **Old Service Files** (Backup Files)
- `services/waifu_service_old.py` - Contains old 1-5★ gacha system
- `cogs/commands/waifu_summon_old.py` - Old constellation commands
- **Impact**: These are backup files, not actively used

### 3. **Data Source** (Expected)
- `data/character_sql.csv` contains 173 characters with 4-5★ base rarities
- **Status**: This is correct! These characters are now obtainable through upgrades only
- **4★ Characters**: 65 (obtainable by upgrading 3★ characters)
- **5★ Characters**: 108 (obtainable by upgrading 4★ characters)

## 🔧 System Behavior Changes:

### **Before (Old Constellation System)**:
- Direct gacha for 1-5★ characters
- Constellation levels on duplicates
- Complex pity system with multiple rates

### **After (New Star System)**:
- **Gacha**: Only 1-3★ characters available
- **Upgrades**: 4-5★ achieved through shard collection
- **Automatic**: Instant upgrades when sufficient shards collected
- **Shop**: Guarantee tickets capped at 3★ maximum
- **Progression**: Clear shard → star upgrade path

## 🎯 Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### ✅ **Working Systems**:
1. **Gacha**: 1-3★ summons with new rates
2. **Upgrades**: Automatic star progression through shards
3. **Shop**: Updated guarantee tickets (3★ max)
4. **Collection**: Star-based display and progress tracking
5. **Profiles**: Shard progress and upgrade readiness indicators

### 🎮 **User Experience**:
- Pull characters (1-3★ only)
- Duplicates automatically give shards
- Sufficient shards = instant upgrade notification
- Clear progression path visible in collection/profile
- Shop items align with new system (no impossible 5★ guarantees)

## 📊 **Database Character Distribution**:
- **1★**: 2,241 characters (Common tier)
- **2★**: 216 characters (Uncommon tier)  
- **3★**: 99 characters (Rare tier)
- **4★**: 65 characters (Epic tier - upgrade only)
- **5★**: 108 characters (Legendary tier - upgrade only)

**Total**: 2,729 characters with balanced progression system

## 🚀 **Conclusion**: 
The star system transition is **COMPLETE**! All core functionality now works with the new 1-3★ gacha + upgrade system. The old 5★ direct pulls have been successfully eliminated and replaced with a more engaging progression system.

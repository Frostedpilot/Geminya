Comparison: Old vs New Battlefield Conditions Architecture

print("\n📊 OLD ARCHITECTURE (Game Loop Handles Effects)")
print("-" * 50)
print("""
🔹 Battlefield Conditions System:
   - Stores effect descriptions as strings
   - Applies stat modifiers only
   - Does NOT execute special effects

🔹 Game Loop (Battle System):
   - Parses effect descriptions
   - Executes turn-by-turn effects manually
   - Contains all effect logic mixed with battle logic

Example Old Code:
```python
# In battlefield conditions - only stores data
effect = {"description": "All characters can act twice per turn"}

# In battle system - parses and executes
if 'act twice per turn' in description.lower():
    character.max_actions_per_turn = 2  # Game loop does this!
```

❌ Problems:
   - Tight coupling between battle and conditions
   - Effect logic scattered across files  
   - Hard to reuse in different battle systems
   - Difficult to maintain and extend

print("\n✅ NEW ARCHITECTURE (Self-Contained Effects)")
print("-" * 50)
print("""
🔹 Battlefield Conditions System:
   - Stores structured effect data
   - Executes its own effects via methods
   - Provides clean interfaces for battle systems

🔹 Game Loop (Battle System):
   - Calls battlefield system methods
   - No effect parsing or execution logic
   - Focuses only on battle flow

Example New Code:
```python
# In battlefield conditions - handles everything
class BattlefieldEffect:
    def setup_turn_modifiers(self, character):
        if 'act twice per turn' in self.description:
            return {'max_actions': 2}  # Self-contained!

# In battle system - just calls methods
modifiers = battlefield_system.process_turn_start(character)
max_actions = modifiers['max_actions']  # Clean interface!
```

✅ Benefits:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Effect logic contained in one place
   - Easy to reuse across different systems
   - Simple to maintain and extend
   - Better testability

print("\n🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS")
print("-" * 50)
print("""
1. 🏗️  MODULARITY
   Old: Effects mixed with battle logic
   New: Effects self-contained in their own system

2. 🔧 MAINTENANCE  
   Old: Change effect → update multiple files
   New: Change effect → update one place

3. 🔄 REUSABILITY
   Old: Battle-specific effect implementations
   New: Any battle system can use same effects

4. 🧪 TESTABILITY
   Old: Must test through full battle system
   New: Can test effects in isolation

5. 📈 EXTENSIBILITY
   Old: Adding effects requires game loop changes
   New: Add effects by extending condition classes
""")

print("\n🚀 EXAMPLE: Adding a New Effect")
print("-" * 50)
print("""
OLD WAY (Multiple Files):
1. Add effect description to battlefield_conditions.json
2. Add parsing logic to battle system
3. Add execution logic to battle system  
4. Test through full battle simulation

NEW WAY (Single Location):
1. Add effect to battlefield_conditions.json
2. Add execution method to BattlefieldEffect class
3. Effect automatically works in any battle system!

print("\n✅ CONCLUSION")
print("-" * 50)
print("""
The new self-contained architecture provides:
- Better code organization
- Easier maintenance  
- Higher reusability
- Cleaner interfaces
- More robust testing

This is a significant improvement in the system's design! 🎉

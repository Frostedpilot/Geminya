Itsuki Nakano is the fifth sister of the Nakano Quintuplets. She is attributed as the ""first girl"" of the series. Itsuki is serious and diligent, yet she's also a glutton and crybaby.

Itsuki is a serious girl, usually getting up early compared to her sisters. She also has good manners, to the point where she cares a lot about manners. She has never been late or skipped a class, and always speaks polite language.

Itsuki has been seen to be a girl who holds a grudge, this is shown when she rejects Fuutarou Uesugi's teaching, in part, due to their earlier dispute. She is also someone who cannot be honest with herself and has a hard time being more direct. Both of these qualities often make her fight alone. Itsuki is often too precise in the timing of food cooking.

Itsuki sometimes tends to be a crybaby, whether it's due to unfavorable situations, scary things, or her stubborn self.

Itsuki has a large appetite and is mainly seen eating throughout the series. It seems like she doesn't mind treating her sisters unfairly when it comes to things related to food. When Itsuki proposes to share their cakes, Ichika suspects that his real goal is to try all the flavors. Itsuki worries about Fuutarou, but it's really because he's hungry.

According to Ichika, Fuutarou has to be firm to deal with Nino and kind to deal with Itsuki.

Nino Nakano is one of the main characters of the 5-toubun no Hanayome series. She is the second sister of the Nakano Quintuplets who usually acts as the mother of the family; cooking for them and taking care of their medical needs. Among the five sisters, she is the one who has the highest hostility towards Fuutarou Uesugi and often rebelled against him early in the series.

Nino has an outgoing personality and is socially aware, resulting in her having many friends and is a social butterfly. She has a sharp tongue and talks bluntly when confronting others, even to her sisters. Her rebellious attitude makes her the least cooperative girl among the sisters, making her archetype resemble that of a ""tsundere.""

Birthday: April 15
Height: 178 cm

Fuutarou Uesugi is the main protagonist of the series. He is a serious and hardworking high school student, and a prodigy at the top of his grade. Due to financial reasons, he is tasked to tutor the Nakano Quintuplets.

According to Isanari, Fuutarou used to be similar to his father as a child, having a wild personality and being bad at studying. He currently lives a frugal lifestyle, preferring solitude. Someone comments that Fuutarou is always like this, trying not to associate himself with everything. Ichika comments that Fuutarou is direct and doesn't mince words. Yotsuba's first impression of Fuutarou is that he is a gloomy man and doesn't have many friends. His facial expression is always serious, sometimes he looks grumpy and annoyed, and he rarely blushes or gets flustered. Fuutarou thinks that being the Class Representative would only be hindering his studies.

Fuutarou is noted to have a big ego and high confidence. He can also be rude and direct, but he is actually able to contain his emotions. Despite that, Fuutarou could momentarily lose his composure when agitated and faced with unfavorable circumstances. He also does not like to get involved with other people's problems, as they find it troublesome.

Fuutarou has been shown to be very hardworking and has a lot of patience, as he is able to tutor several girls who have below average scores. It is personally stated and implied that Fuutarou currently has no interest in romantic relationships. He considers love as something silly.

Raiha describes Fuutarou as an ""overconfident"" guy and a ""study freak"".

Nino encourages Fuutarou about his future love life, despite labeling him a tactless guy. Ichika also said the same thing when she visited him in the hospital.

Fuutarou has a habit of covering his mouth with his left hand when he feels embarrassed

150916,Reina Aharen,阿波連 玲奈,,"A girl who is not good at keeping a good distance with others. One day, Shouta Raidou, who was sitting next to her, picked up the eraser she dropped on the floor for her. It was the start of her interest in him.

Reina is a short teenage girl with long silver hair and deep blue eyes. She is seen most of the time to have a stoic expression even when laughing or crying. Despite that, she is capable of smiling and becoming cheerful, mostly when Raido is present. She is mostly seen in her school uniform that consists of dark blue button-up outfit over a white dress shirt, a dark navy skirt, long black tights, and brown penny loafers.

Reina is a quiet and timid girl with a bad sense of gauging interpersonal distance. She is shy when talking to people she just met, to the point where her voice becomes so soft it's almost inaudible. Inversely, she often becomes too excited when interacting with people which leads her to act overtly familiar to people she just met. This coupled with her generally expressionless face has led to her being ostracized in the past which made her scared to get close to others. Due to this, Reina is incredibly appreciative to those who accept her despite her strange behaviors such as her friends and family. She often feels obliged to repay their kindness to her with whatever means she has (e.g: making them food, teaching them, etc).

Due to her inability to gauge interpersonal distance, Reina is often self-conscious of the way she is viewed by her friends. She also fears being a burden to them due to her own perceived inability. Despite that, she is willing to step up when her friends need her and isn't afraid to show her appreciation to them. Reina values the friends she has made in high school greatly and has expressed her desire that she wishes for them to continue being friends long after their graduation.

150918, Raidou,来堂,,"A very ordinary high school boy. His aim is to have 100 friends in the high school. After entering the school, however, he feels a distance between him and Aharen, who is in the next seat to him.

Raidō is a tall boy with a stoic face. He has short black hair and brown eyes. He is most often seen wearing his school uniform consisting of a white shirt, black pants, black belt, and white sneakers. He usually retains the same facial expression even when internally feeling a lot of emotions such as happiness, sadness, shock, determination, etc.

Raidō is an outwardly calm and generally stoic teenager who looks after Reina. He is rather stiff when it comes to facial expressions which has led to him being distant from others in the past. This led to him having a motivation to have a fulfilling high school life with a goal to make 100 friends. Although outwardly stiff, Raidō is quite friendly with others especially after getting to know them. This is most apparent with his interactions with Reina. Whereas their interactions were initially filled with awkwardness and confusion, as their relationship progresses he begins to do more activities with Reina including but not limited to playing several sports together, studying, dancing, playing board games, etc. His friendliness would also help dissipate the initial tension with Mitsuki, Reina's childhood friend, who thought him as a scary person tricking Reina. Afterwards, he would also eventually earn other friends such as Ishikawa, Hanako, and Riku.

Despite his outward appearance, Raidō is internally both expressive and imaginative. This is most often seen when confronted with something he doesn't understand, such as Reina behaving weirdly. In these instances, Raidō's imagination runs wild and he begins to think up unlikely explanations for whatever he's facing. These delusions can range from somewhat unbelievable to utterly illogical. In some cases, he often adds to his delusion until his explanation of becomes more and more absurd. He also often acts based upon these delusions and it isn't until the real explanation is revealed that Raidō becomes aware and immediately dismisses his ridiculous theories. Raidō has expressed that he is aware of his tendencies to jump to unlikely conclusions and sees it as a problem, but has reasoned that he does so to be prepared for anything.

Raidō is also quite frank when it comes to expressing his emotions and is generally not afraid to do something when it feels like something he should do. For example, when Reina kept her distance from him after her being close to him for a full day during their first interaction, he made the first move instead and pushed his table to hers, an act which would be the start of their friendship. He is vocally bold when declaring that he has set his mind on something, although he is just as quick to let it go when his actions turn out to be based on his false delusions. Raidō is not shy when expressing his emotions and not afraid to stand by them, even for something as delicate as romance. When Mitsuki, under the assumption that he was leading Reina on, challenged him to a game of reversi, he was initially afraid until Mitsuki expressed her condition that he cut off contact with Reina should he lose. This gave him a boost of determination which prompted him to defeat Mitsuki from his losing position. After officially becoming Reina's boyfriend, he does not hesitate to compliment her appearance or express his affection towards her in general. He states them casually as a matter of fact, often to the embarrassment of Reina.

Height: 165 cm
Weight: 55 kg

Koyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.

Koyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.

It is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.

Although he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.

Other characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a ""threat"" to her.

He is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.

Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.

His personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.

Due to events prior to Kizumonogatari and Bakemonogatari, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

Height: 158 cm

Favorite phrase/slogan: ""I don't know everything, I just know what I know."" (何でもは知らないわよ。知ってることだけ。, Nandemo wa shiranaiwa yo. Shitteru koto dake.)

She styles her hair into two braids and ties them with a hair ribbon that has a cat design. She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.

Hanekawa Tsubasa is Araragi's classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as ""the class president of all class presidents."" The reason Tsubasa and Hitagi cut their hair short is because they learned Araragi likes it short.

Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.

22054,Suruga Kanbaru,神原 駿河,,"Age: 17 (Beginning), 18 (Monogatari Series: Off &amp; Monster Season onwards)
Birthday: May 9

Suruga, the main character of Suruga Monkey, is Koyomi's underclassman, star of the school's basketball team and one of Hitagi's acquaintances from back in junior high school. She is so well known in her school that not a single student had not heard of her, mostly because it was her who was responsible of the rapid rise of success of the school's girls basketball team due to her talents. She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, lolicon and masochist. Her hobbies include reading yaoi literature and playing basketball. Although her sexual preference is clearly towards females, she does not have a hard time interacting with males, and she even manages to say teasing remarks when she is comfortable with the person she talks to (i.e. Araragi). She is 160cm tall.

Suruga is a girl with brown eyes and dark bluish hair. Because of her club activities as a basketball varsity player, she boasts an athletic physique, although she admits that her breasts might not be ample enough for Araragi to notice.

Her clothing style reflects her boyish personality; when she is not in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, she often wears sleeveless clothing and shorts. Whichever clothes she wears, she is regularly seen wearing cycling shorts, which she considers to be her underwear, much to Araragi's shock upon hearing it straight from her (as it implies that she does not wear panties).

Nadeko, a main character of the Monogatari Series, has been Tsukihi's friend since elementary school. She wears a waist pouch, casts her eyes downward, has bangs covering her eyes, has a shy personality, and can be easily amused. Koyomi played with her a lot whenever she visited his house after being invited by his sisters. She refers to Koyomi as Koyomi onii-chan and appears to have feelings for him.

Nadeko Snake Arc

She's quite protective of her hair (particularly her forelocks) thinking that it's her place to guard more than her panties. When she finally combed her forelocks aside in Nisemonogatari, Koyomi commented that she has a glare just like a serpent, foreshadowing the story of Nadeko Medusa.

He is a part of the Senjougahara family, whose life changed when the young Hitagi was diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition. Although Hitagi managed to survive the ordeal, Hitagi's mother joined a cult out of desperation for ensuring Hitagi's safety; ironically, this also dragged the mother's attention away from the rest of the family. Years later, when Hitagi was struck by an oddity that left her almost weightless, five conmen who promised to cure Hitagi's condition left the family penniless. Hitagi's mother leaves the family for good since then, leaving behind her husband in debt while he struggles to earn a living for Hitagi's sake.

Kikuri Hiroi is a supporting character of the manga and anime series, Bocchi the Rock!. She is the bassist and the vocalist of the band, SICK HACK.

Kikuri is drunk in most of the scenes during the series. For that reason, she is often fined for causing trouble such as breaking the equipment during concerts, and because of that, she drinks more liquor, so although she has some income at the concert, she is always short of money.

Unlike today, where she behaves freely, Hiroi had a reclusive, gloomy personality until high school. The reason she started drinking was to suppress the tension of concert performances. She sees a lot of qualities that overlap with her former self in Bocchi and occasionally gives advice as a senpai bandsman.

Nijika Ijichi's older sister. When they were both young they didn't particularly get along. However, due to their mother's passing and their father's business travels, Seika and Nijika's bond grew stronger and they became close.

She is the owner &amp; manager of the live house STARRY - and her family home is in the apartment above.

Seika lacks practical skills and, due to STARRY, usually has an incredibly busy schedule. As such, her sister performs most of the chores around their home (cooking/cleaning etc).

Described by Nijika as a ""tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-dere"" for her, seemingly cold, tough love approach when it comes to both kessoku band and her sister. Even though it is clear that she cares for both deep down, her efforts to portray this could be considered tactless. (Ex. Seika left a concert spot open for kessuko band even after claiming they weren't good enough).

She was previously the lead guitarist in a band. She states her reason for quitting was due to disinterest. Nijika stipulates that Seika opened STARRY for her as she used to bring her sister along to concerts when she was younger (due to the lack of parental presence), these are some of Nijika's fondest memories. Seika would never admit this to anyone.

She was Kikuri Hyori's senpai and friend during college and inspired the latter's interest in rock music. Whilst always apprehensive of Kikuri, even going as far as to reprimand her (along with Ryo) for borrowing money and not repaying in an acceptable amount of time, Seika clearly cares for her - allowing her to use their shower and crash at their place if Kikuri needs to.

Tomoyo, Madison Taylor in the English dub, is the best friend of the series heroine, Sakura Kinomoto. When she discovers that Sakura has become the Cardcaptor, she becomes Sakura's primary assistant by designing ""battle costumes"" and filming all of her magical (and non-magical) endeavours. (The videotaping, however, seems to be more to Tomoyo's personal benefit and enjoyment than it is to Sakura's.) Tomoyo faithfully keeps Sakura's new identity secret and often covers for her in times of need.

Tomoyo is very mature for her age. One of her major character traits is her selflessness towards Sakura. Tomoyo is kind, caring, highly intelligent, beautiful, meticulous, and very melodic (she has a superb singing voice and often has solos in choir recitals). She always speaks using formal verb conjugations and expressions, giving her a unique air of refinement amongst the cast. When needed, Tomoyo can exhibit considerable cunning and resourcefulness, which was most prominently displayed in the final movie.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/55687.jpg,1826,anime,232

Residency: currently in Sakura's room
Real appearance: A large lion-like animal with armour

Cerberus, nicknamed ""Kero,"" is the appointed guardian of the book which holds the Clow Cards. He is one of two magical creatures created by Clow Reed along with the Clow Cards. Before his death, Clow appointed Kero as the one to select the potential candidate to be the next master of the cards, Cerberus himself, and his ""brother"" and fellow guardian, Yue. After Sakura accidentally releases the cards, Cerberus chooses her to be the candidate and teaches her the basics of capturing the cards. Throughout the series, he displays an extensive knowledge of mysticism. After Sakura passes the final judgment to become the Clow Cards master, Cerberus remains with her as a friend, companion, adviser, and protector when new threats appear.

Having spent a lengthy amount of time in the book while it was in Osaka, Cerberus speaks with a pointed Osakan-accent. He tends to be bossy, demanding, egotistical, and a glutton, but clearly displays his affection for Sakura, especially if she is hurt or in danger. He becomes very fond of video games, and is addicted to sweets. Cerberus spends most of his time in a ""false form"", a small figure resembling an orange-stuffed animal with wings. Unlike Yue, Cerberus draws his life energy from the sun and is not dependent on the magical power of his master. However, his master must have control of the Firey and Light cards in order to power his true form, a large-winged cat. In the anime adaptation, the Firey card is changed to the Earthy card to avoid to delay his obtaining his true form. Cerberus' name is taken from the Greek mythological figure, Cerberus, a large three-headed beast who was assigned to guard the gates of Hades.

In the anime adaptation, his false form is voiced by Aya Hisakawa, while his hidden form is voiced by Masaya Onosaka. In the English release of the anime adaptation, his name is spelled Kerberos. In the English adaptation, Cardcaptors, it is changed to Keroberos. His false form is voiced by Matt Hill and Richard Newman voices his true form.

Ruby Moon is one of two magical guardians created by Eriol Hiiragizawa. The counterpart to the original guardian Yue, Ruby Moon is genderless but prefers to act as a female. When Eriol transfers to Tomoeda Elementary, Ruby Moon created a false form named Nakuru Akizuki and enrolls in Seijou High School, entering the same class as Toya Kinomoto, Sakura's brother, and Yukito Tsukishiro, the false form of Yue who is unaware of his true nature. As Akizuki, she acts as a general annoyance, deliberately interfering every time Toya tries to talk to Yukito about the latter's dwindling energy. She claims she wants to consume Toya's energy herself, though it is never stated that she actually has a need for it nor why she couldn't simply steal it. When Toya is finally able to speak with Yue and give him all of his magical energy to sustain Yue's life, Akizuki gives up her pursuit. In the final battle, Ruby Moon battles Yue and initially appears to be winning. However, Yue is able to get past her due to his greater determination and desire to protect Sakura.

3456,Eriol Hiiragizawa,柊沢 エリオル,Eli Moon,"Birthday: March 23

Eriol Hiiragizawa is the principal antagonist in the second half of the series, commonly called the Master of the Clow arc. The reincarnation of Clow Reed, Eriol has both Clow's memories and all of his magic power. He has a magical staff similar to Clow Reed's, can control Clow's creations Yue and Cerberus, and has created his own similar pair of guardians: Ruby Moon and Spinel Sun. He moves from England to transfer to Tomoeda Elementary school after Sakura Kinomoto passed the Last Judgement and became the official master of the cards. He is depicted as a quiet, mature boy while at school, though he also shows a mischievous side when he regularly joins classmate Takashi Yamazaki in weaving complex lies about the history of objects, places, and events. While seeming a normal student to Sakura, Syaoran Li is suspicious of him. It is soon shown that Yue and Cerberus are able to detect his magical signature as being Clow's, and Eriol must erase Yue's memories after he is accidentally seen by him.

Eriol came to Japan in order to aid Sakura and force her to use her own magical powers to convert the Clow Cards into Sakura cards. This is necessary as the cards take their magical energy from their master, but until Sakura converted them, they could not use her magic and were slowly dying. The guardian Yue also was suffering the same fate, forcing Sakura's brother to ""feed"" him all of his magical power to prevent Yue, and his false form Yukito, from dying.

Sakura does not become aware that Eriol is causing all of the magical disasters that are causing her to convert the cards until near the end of the series when Eriol reveals himself to her. He puts the city to sleep and challenges Sakura to convert the last two cards, the Dark and the Light, which must be converted together. After Sakura successfully does so, he then tells her that she is now more powerful than Clow Reed and asks her to perform one final task for him: to divide his own magical power between himself and her father Fujitaka—the other reincarnation of Clow Reed—so that Eriol will no longer be the most powerful magician in the world. He then takes Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo, Yue, and Cerberus to his home where he explains why he had to give her a reason to convert the cards, as her doing so without a need could have sent the cards out of control or drained Sakura's own life.

Eriol's true age is unknown, as he used his magic to halt his aging process to remain the same physical age as Sakura. He is romantically involved with Kaho Mizuki, whom he originally sent from England to aid Sakura in the Final Judgment and who offers Sakura support through letters during the second arc. At the end of the manga series, she returns with him to England, and in the second anime movie, they are shown together when Sakura calls for advice.

In the anime series, Eriol is the sole reincarnation of Clow Reed, with all of the elements from the manga regarding Fujitaka's relation to Clow and inheriting of half of his powers removed. The final explanation at Eriol's house is also shifted slightly so it takes place the day after the final battle, rather than immediately after, and it is done because Sakura seeks him out rather than his giving an invitation.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/81228.jpg,138,anime,232

Fujitaka Kinomoto is the father of titular character Sakura Kinomoto, and a reincarnation of the creator of the Clow Cards, Clow Reed. A busy professor of archaeology at Towa University, Fujitaka is a kind and caring father. He met his late wife Nadeshiko while doing his first year as a teacher at her high school. Nadeshiko had climbed a tree to return a baby bird to its nest, but fell out of the tree, landing on Fujitaka. Upon seeing her, he stated that ""an angel has fallen from the sky."" They fell in love and married when she was sixteen. Though Nadeshiko died seven years before the start of the series, Fujitaka is shown to still be very much in love with her and devoted to her memory. He keeps a picture of her in the dining room, changing it each morning.

Little is initially said about Fujitaka's family or past. During the second half of the series, it is revealed that when Clow Reed divided his soul, seeking to no longer be the most powerful magician in the world, he split it into two halves, one which became Eriol Hiiragizawa holding all of the magic and memories, and the other being Fujitaka, who has no magic of his own, but fathered the one who would inherit the cards. It is stated that Fujitaka has no magical powers of his own, but he is also unaffected by other people's magic, such as the Eriol's sleep spell. At the end of the series, Eriol gives half of his magic to Fujitaka. This enables Fujitaka to finally see the spirit of Nadeshiko, who has been watching over her family since her death.

In the anime adaptation, Fujitaka's role as the other half of Clow Reed's reincarnation is completely removed as is his immunity to Eriol's magic and he is never able to see Nadeshiko's spirit. He is voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka. In the Cardcaptors English adaptation, his name is changed to Aiden Avalon and he is voiced by Brian Drummond.

Nadeshiko Kinomoto is the mother of the series titular character, Sakura Kinomoto, who died seven years before the series starts. Only seen in flashbacks, photographs, and as a spirit, Nadeshiko was a high school student and professional model when she met and fell in love with Fujitaka Kinomoto, who was her teacher. Her family disapproved of their marriage when Nadeshiko was sixteen. Nadeshiko continued to send gifts to her father, and maintained contact with her cousin Sonomi Daidōji. At the age of 27, Nadeshiko died, and Sonomi, who loved Nadeshiko greatly, blamed Fujitaka. It is hinted that after her death, the Amamiya family cut off all contact with Fujitaka and the children from the marriage, as Sakura is shown learning that Sonomi, who is the mother of her best friend, is a relative, and meeting her great-grandfather (Nadeshiko's grandfather) for the first time as the series progresses.

Though Nadeshiko has died, her love for Fujitaka and her children, and visa versa continues to live on. She frequently visits the family as a winged spirit, though initially only Toya can see her. In the manga, it is noted that Toya likely inherited this power from Nadeshiko, implying she too could see spirits. Throughout the series, she worries over Sakura as the young girl begins gathering the Clow Cards. When the Illusion card tricks Sakura into walking off a cliff, Nadeshiko's spirit grabs her arm and keeps her from falling until Yukito Tsukishiro arrives to catch her. Later in the series, when Sakura develops a high fever, Nadeshiko appears and puts her hand on Sakura's forehead, lowering the fever. When Fujitaka goes to talk to her grandfather for the first time in a long time, she rains Sakura blossoms over them to show her happiness that they are reconciling.

The family is shown to also still love her, most noticeably through a picture kept in the dining area near the kitchen table. Fujitaka changes the picture each morning and Sakura always greets the picture while coming to breakfast. At the end of the series, after Fujitaka receives half of Eriol's powers, he and Nadeshiko are happily ""reunited"" as the magic allows him to finally see her.

In the anime adaptation, Nadeshiko's role is generally unchanged, except that Fujitaka is never able to see her as he does not receive any magical powers. She is voiced by Yūko Minaguchi. In the Cardcaptors English dub, her name is changed to Natasha Avalon and she is voiced by Janyse Jaud.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/70016.jpg,33,anime,232

In Cardcaptor Sakura
Touya is the brother of Sakura Kinomoto. His birthday is on February 29th, which makes him a leap year baby, a person that can only ""properly"" celebrate their birthday once every four years. He holds the belief that as Sakura's older brother, he is the only person entitled to make fun of her, a belief that his best friend Yukito Tsukishiro refers to as a ""sister complex."" However, he is also protective and caring of her, which leads him to dislike Syaoran Li when he finds Syaoran cornering Sakura in the schoolyard. Though Syaoran and Sakura eventually stop fighting, Toya continues to dislike Syaoran when he becomes friends with Sakura, knowing that Syaoran will eventually take Sakura away from him. He is a perceptive young man and has had a vague idea as to what Sakura has been up to as a Cardcaptor, despite Sakura's attempts to keep it a secret.

Toya's main relationship is with his best friend Yukito. Throughout the series Toya and Yukito are extremely close and eventually Yukito openly admits his love for Toya to Sakura after Toya saves his life.Toya was born with some magical ability, allowing him to see ghosts (including the one of his late mother). His magical ability is also what helps him sense when Sakura is in danger or when she is doing other ""magical"" things (which enables him to follow her).

In Tsubasa Chronicles
Touya is the current king of the Clow Country, but he acts pretty much the same as he did in Cardcaptor Sakura.

6768,Meiling Li,李苺鈴,Stéphanie,"Meiling Li is a character that appears only in the anime adaptation of Cardcaptor Sakura. Introduced in episode 19, she is Syaoran Li's cousin and self-proclaimed fiancée. As children living in Hong Kong, they both trained in martial arts under the tutelage of Wang Wei. One night her pet bird escaped from his cage, and the normally quiet and withdrawn Syaoran told her not to cry, then left. After spending hours in the rain, he returned with the bird and Meiling was both grateful and touched. From that day, she devoted herself to him, eventually declaring that she liked him above all others and, reasoning that he liked her as well, she declared them to be engaged. At the same time, she promised that if he ever found someone he liked more than her, she would give him up.

In coming to Tokyo, Meiling intends to help Syaoran gather the Clow Cards, and actively dislikes Sakura. As the series progresses, Meiling develops a grudging respect for Sakura that turns into a good friendship by the time Meiling returns to Hong Kong in episode 43. During her initial visit, Meiling seemed to recognize that Syaoran was falling in love with Sakura, but it wasn't until she briefly returned in episode 60 that she fully acknowledges and accepts Sakura as the person Syaoran loves. Wanting to keep his promise, Syaoran attempts to tell her that he loves Sakura, but Meiling interrupts and tells him that she knows because he is now calling Sakura by her first name, something he only does for his sisters and herself. She smiles at Syaoran with tears in her eyes and declares that the engagement is called off, then quickly leaves. Meiling spends the night at Tomoyo Daidōji's house to release all of her sadness through much screaming and tears without burdening Syaoran. At the end of the episode, Meiling returns home and is not seen again in the main series. She returns in the second movie, with Syaoran, and together with Tomoyo tries to help Sakura confess her own feelings to him.

Unlike Syaoran, Meiling has no magical abilities, relying solely on her physical fighting abilities and a healthy dose of pride. Her lack of powers, however, results in her hindering more than helping Syaoran in most battles against the cards. She challenges the The Fight card in episode 20, and was nearly badly wounded and had to be rescued by Syaoran. Recognizing that she was being a burden, Meiling grew upset and lashed out at Syaoran. However, she was then able to be an aid to him while fighting The Twin card, as their years of practicing martial arts together enables them to match the card's synchronized fighting style.

The character of Meiling is voiced by Yukana Nogami. In the English adaptation Cardcaptors her name is changed to Meilin Rae and her relationship with Syaoran is changed from cousins to childhood friends. She is voiced by Nicole Oliver. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by Julie Maddalena.

Chiharu Mihara is a friend and classmate of Sakura Kinomoto, as well as a fellow member of the cheerleading squad. Chiharu is often in charge of stopping Takashi Yamazaki when he starts spinning lies about the history of objects and events. Though she is regularly seen jokingly strangling him or dragging him away by his collar, they have been friends since kindergarten and are a couple. At the end of the series when Sakura is struggling to come to terms with her feelings for Syaoran, Chiharu gives her advice about love and acknowledging your true feelings.

In the anime adaptation, Chiharu and Yamazaki's relationship is less clearly stated, but she gives him chocolates for Valentine's Day and they are frequently seen together both in and out of school. When Sakura is shown a world where everyone connected to the cards has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Chiharu and Yamazaki are shown reacting to one another as virtual strangers. Chiharu's name is changed to Chelsea in the Cardcaptors English adaptation of the series, and she and Yamazaki are changed from a couple to cousins displaying sibling rivalry.

Born of an English father and a Chinese mother, Clow created a new type of magic that blended both Eastern and Western magical elements. His plan was to hand down the magic to people who would use and protect it while meeting all of the qualifications, however few people could learn his brand of magic. The character of Clow is only seen in flash backs, as he has long been dead before the series starts.

5771,Rika Sasaki,佐々木 利佳,,"Rika Sasaki is a classmate and friend of titular character Sakura Kinomoto. She is considered to be very elegant and mature for her age, though she can also be shy. During the series, she is also shown to be a skilled cook and very good at crafts. During the series, Rika is affected by the Clow Cards several times. Early in the series, she buys a brooch that is actually The Sword card. The card takes her over and causes her to attack Sakura. Sakura is able to stop Rika by using The Illusion card to show her an image of her beloved, allowing Sakura to capture the card. During the second half of the series, she is nearly drowned during a magical trial Eriol Hiiragizawa created to cause Sakura to convert a Clow Card to Sakura Card.

During the series, Rika is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her teacher Yoshiyuki Terada. In the manga series, they are engaged to be married when she is old enough, and they frequently spend time alone together on ""dates."" In the anime adaptation, the engagement is removed as are many of their dates, however they are still shown to have affection for one another. Rika gives Terada the hand-made teddy bear she made, and he names it after her. In both the manga and anime, when Sakura uses the Illusion card to stop Rika's attacks, she calls the image ""Sensei"" which means ""teacher"" in Japanese. During the final judgment when Yue shows Sakura a world where everyone has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Rika is shown handing Terada a paper without her usual blush and shy look.

In the Cardcaptors English adaptation, Rika's name is changed to Rita and all hints of her relationship with Terada are removed. Instead of being a good student, she is depicted as having trouble with her school work and her blushing around Terada is explained away as being embarrassed at having to stay after school so often.

Nicknamed Suppi by Ruby Moon, Spinel Sun spends most of his time reading and projects a calm demeanor. Ruby Moon often teases him that he needs to have more fun. During the series, he mostly remains out of sight of the main characters, except when he once runs into Cerberus in his false form. Fortunately for him, Cerberus doesn't suspect anything and instead declares him a monster and feeds him sweets, not realizing that the sweets would turn Spinel Sun into a hyperactive eating machine. Cerberus does not learn his true identity until just before the final battle where the two cats face one another. Initially, Spinel Sun appears to have the upper hand, however Cerberus' greater determination to protect Sakura enable him to defeat him.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/81229.jpg,65,anime,232

He is also shown teaching in other classes, including the physical education classes, and he acts as the chaperon on school several field trips. As the series progresses, it is revealed that he is having a romantic relationship with his student Rika Sasaki. In the manga, they become engaged when he gives her a ring, noting that he hopes it will one day become her wedding ring. Rika gives him a teddy bear she made and named after herself, which legends says will allow them to remain in love forever. Towards the end of the series, when Sakura is unsure of her feelings about Li, the couple is shown having a picnic at a park, with Terada slipping away so Sakura doesn't notice him. During the series, none of the other characters appear to know about the relationship, though when Rika is taken over by the Sword card, Sakura hears her call out ""Sensei"" (teacher) when she uses the illusion card to show Rika her most beloved.

In the anime adaptation, their relationship is not shown in the same light. Their engagement and more romantic scenes between them are removed, and Rika notes that Terada reminds her of her absentee father. Terada is also shown accepting cakes made by Rika and in accepting the bear and naming it after his ""hardest working student."" In the Cardcaptors English dub, he is simply called Mr. Terada, and all aspects of the romantic relationship between Terada and Rika are completely removed, with Rika's shyness and reactions to him made to appear to be more of a general fear of men than romantic feelings.

7138,Takashi Yamazaki,山崎 貴史,Zachary|Zach,"Takashi Yamazaki is a student in Sakura Kinomoto's class, and the only male student in the class to be referred to by name before the introduction of Syaoran Li. The character is named after film director, Takashi Yamazaki, who is a friend of the series creators, CLAMP. Throughout the series, Yamazaki's defining trait is his ability to fabricate highly detailed fake stories and histories about practically any subject. While most of his classmates see through these fabrications, Sakura and Syaoran often believe them. When the character Eriol Hiiragizawa is introduced in the second half of the series, he becomes Yamazaki's storytelling ally. The two are able to respond to one another's clues perfectly and spin complex stories on the fly.

Fellow classmate Chiharu Mihara often interrupts his stories so others know when he is lying, and proceeds to punish him for lying by pretending to strangle him or by dragging him away by his collar. While the two often seem to be arguing, they are actually a couple and have known one another since kindergarten. She is the only girl in the series that he addresses by her first name. Despite Yamazaki's often joking nature, he is shown to have a serious and sensitive side as well, willing to jump into a fierce wave to attempt to save fellow classmate Rika from drowning, and leaving Chiharu alone to talk to Sakura when Sakura was struggling with her feelings for Syaoran.

In the anime adaptation, Yamazaki is the only character to be rarely shown with his eyes open. His relationship with Chiharu is left more ambiguous, though on the day of Judgement when Sakura is shown a world in which everyone losing their feelings for the person they love the most, Yamazaki and Chiharu lose their feelings for each other and are shown to be strangers.

In the Cardcaptors English adaptation, Yamazaki's name is changed to Zachary Marker and all hints of his relationship with Chiharu are removed. Instead, they are said to be cousins and the Chiharu's joking strangling of Yamazaki is considered to be sibling rivalry.

Yamazaki is voiced by Issei Miyazaki in the anime adaptation, and by Philip Pacaud in Cardcaptors. In the English dub of the second film, he is voiced by Joshua Seth.

Naoko loves to read, particularly fantasy stories and ghost stories. She finds mysterious situations fascinating and shows no fear of scary situations. In the 31st episode of the anime adaptation, Naoko accidentally acquires the The Create card, which had disguised itself as a book. In book form, The Create would create anything that Naoko wrote in the book, though she was unaware of it. This results in Sakura and company having to deal with a confusing area of odd mystical creatures and circumstances, including a fire-breathing dragon. When she goes to bed and closes the book, the card's power is stopped and Sakura is able to capture it. When Naoko wakes in the morning to find the book gone, she thinks it disappeared from a supernatural experience and is happy. 

During an interview, Clamp noted that they had originally intended for the character to have a long-distance boyfriend, but the chapter featuring that story was cut out of the series. 

Naoko is voiced by Emi Motoi. In the English adaptation Cardcaptors, her name is changed to Nikki and she is voiced by Kelly Sheridan. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by Sherry Lynn.

On the outside he acts very cold and aloof and is serious and intimidating. Yue makes his first appearance when Sakura, the Cardcaptor, captures the final Clow Card, The Earthy.

Chika is a light skinned woman with very long, curly mint colored hair worn in a high ponytail with a black and green twin-bow piece with few bangs and long curls of hair framing her face. Her eyes are an almond-red color.

Chika has shown tendencies of being obsessed with herself, and Vert, who is almost like a sister to her. This can be proven during the Leanbox ending where Nepgear and Vert are shown to be dressing up together and she is jealousy watching with a curious Neptune. She even mentions that her first priority is always Vert and that she has a plaque to prove it. She also has very intimate moments with Vert as well, which may mean she has feelings for Vert.

Histoire is a quiet girl with a sense of justice. She looks to be no older then Gust, but is very powerful and strong. She is also very knowledgeable, but it can take her days on end just to find the right information she needs...

Usually Histoire is happy or joyful, and often peppers her words with emoticons. She seems to lack a temper and has a very gentle voice, although in the Manga she does have just a bit of a temper, kicking out Neptune, Blanc, and Vert from their current living locations due to not taking their roles of Goddesses responsibly. 

She also loses her temper and lashes out at Neptune and Nepgear in the prologue chapter of Hyperdimension Neptunia V after having tolerated both sisters' laziness for too long.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/206097.jpg,18,anime,16157

IF is a headstrong girl who acts completely serious and only wishes to focus on important task to finish them first and above all else. She really hates doing useless or unecessary things if they do not help or achieve anything to her or the group.
Despite her serious nature, she has a very sarcastic humor, but she comes off as a relaxed person until pushed enough to grow annoyed.

Rei seems to be the very sensitive, gentle type of character who somehow manages to handle being bullied, teased, and harassed on a daily basis very well. She tries to keep things in order, but she seems to be very pathetic, according to others. She has a lot of trouble speaking decently in front of people and lacks any actual powers. She has barely any confidence, possibly none at all, and is always fearful.

Nepgear is the human form of Purple Sister and also the little sister of Neptune. She first appears in mk2 and in the Manga.

In contrast to Neptune's hyper active and energetic behavior, Nepgear is a very shy girl who will over-apologize for even the tiniest of things. She's somewhat timid when it comes to things and people but friendly otherwise. Once she has made a friend, no matter what they think of her later she will hold them closely, such as when Uni angrily left and began to hate Nepgear upon finding out that Nepgear fled and left their sisters behind.

However, she is usually skipping out on her Goddess duties, much like how Neptune would if given the chance to go and have fun instead. Considering she is seen holding a Neptune doll, she may very much like Neptune.

Waist: 55

Uni is Noire's younger sister. Uni seems to be friendlier than Noire is, and befriends Nepgear quickly in the game until learning of her relation to Neptune. However, she is still very much a tsundere.

While she and her sister look nearly identical, Uni is a lot friendlier and perky in comparison. Comparing her relationship with Nepgear, it's a lot better then Neptune and Noire's at first. Much like her sister, however, she is a tsundere and says things like ""I guess I'll let you..."". 

Uni seems to take pride in her fighting and is usually practicing in her spare time or learning how to take over Lastation possibly, as seen in one of the ending images where she is seen practicing karate with a nervous/worried Nepgear, or how she can be seen doing sit ups in another official picture.

Uni seems also to be less serious then Noire and seems to enjoy her time with the other younger sisters. She has her times however, such as helping the others in one manga chapter when they dressed as spies and snuck into a Pirachu-esque place

It's mentioned she does not like to be girly, meaning Uni may have tomboy traits which can be shown during her last Chriper event she has a hobby of collecting guns and in another event where she rather prefers to play at an arcade with Nepgear than do thing a normal teenage girl would do. She eventually gives in however, upon rescuing Noire and after Noire later comments on how strong she's gotten Uni begins to cry in joy much to her sister's surprise. Uni is also self-conscious of her appearance shown when Nepgear asks about her breasts when she transforms for Uni to angrily deny the topic and say it's now off-limits. She also is highly jealous and shocked when she finds out her underwear was sold for the least price in an auction by Gust who was selling the CPU Candidates items.

Uni is a light skinned girl with long black (almost light blue colored) hair with most of it worn down reaching her chest with some of it worn in pigtails held with light blue and black ribbons. Her eyes are red like Noire's but are darker in comparison. Uni's color scheme consists of black, milky blue, and white/silver. Wearing a black dress with milky blue lining, a odd belt like piece with a bow behind it and a big circle with white lining connecting the dress to her collar. She wears long fingerless black gloves with milky blue coloring at the top and similar short boots. On the left side she can be seen with a small device that is most likely a cellphone (or even a PSP in reference to her theme).

Unlike the others, Uni in terms of color and appearance while in HDD form resembles Noire almost exactly. Both wearing black with silver and white coloring with white hair. While Noire's eyes are glowing blue-green in HDD form, Uni as Black Sister has green eyes. When comparing the outfits, Black Sister has a lot more revealed in comparison to Black Heart.

As Black Sister her hair turns a very light gray/white and is worn in curled ringlets/drills while her bangs spike outward and the side parts are shorter and very curled. Her eyes become bright green. Her outfit, consist of a normal bathing suit like body piece greatly resembling her dress with more detailing on each part and two big circle pieces worn in her hair.

She is also rather clumsy, often tripping over and forgetting things. She also doesn't have many friends, as shown that in her mobile phone, she only has Dekomori Sanae and her older sister Touka as contacts.

Kotomi is another schoolmate of Tomoya's in the same year, but, like Kyou, is in a separate class from Tomoya. The ""Koto"" in Kotomi is derived from the Japanese musical stringed instrument of the same name. She is in the top ten for every subject throughout the whole country in standardized exam results—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a very quiet girl and it is quite difficult to communicate with her. In her spare time, she plays the violin, although she is very poor at it to the point of causing pain to those who hear her play.

Tomoya Okazaki is the male protagonist of Clannad. Due to his habit of always arriving late to school, skipping classes during the day, and staying out all night, he has been labeled as a delinquent, or a young person who defies authority.

He is a childhood friend of Kotomi Ichinose and is best friends with Youhei Sunohara. As he progresses through high school, he meets many new friends, such as Kyou, Ryou, Tomoyo, Fuko, and of course Nagisa. He has a knack for solving the problems of his friends, and seems to care for all of them deeply. He is also seemingly unaware that some of the girls at school show interest in him.

Height: 5'9"" (175.3 cm)
Weight: 187 lbs (85.4 kg)
Birth year: 737 Age
Hobby: Fighting strong opponents
Favorite food: Everything
Favorite vehicle: Kintoun (Nimbus)

Originally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).

Dragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu &amp; Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins &amp; Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) &amp; consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).

In Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.

In Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike Dragon Ball GT), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.

In Cross Epoch, the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.

In Dragon Ball Minus, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine &amp; Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.

Gokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.

He's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent).

Goku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of Dragon Ball Kai. In Dragon Ball Super Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten &amp; Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).

She wears a black and red dress underneath a golden breastplate, a white belt cloth, metal bands around her upper arms, and light green and black boots. Initially, she dons a bouncy, yellowish-green hat. After taking her reward from Gomah's treasure trove, she wears a green and gold necklace, as well as a golden crown adorned with blue and red jewels that resembles the same crown worn by Princess Gwaelin from the original Dragon Quest game.

After Degesu is ordered by Gomah to obtain the Evil Third Eye, he in turn orders the Beautiful Woman to fetch it for him. She approaches Hybis, managing to trade her hat for the belt containing the Evil Third Eye. She later delivers the belt to Gomah, and in exchange, takes a heaping bag of riches from Gomah's treasure trove. She helps Gomah again by embedding the Evil Third Eye in his forehead, but is quickly frightened by his sudden transformation and flees, but not before returning to pick up two jewels she dropped in her initial attempt to leave.

Height: 5' 5""
Weight: 108 lbs
Birth year: 733 Age
Hobby: Inventing
Favorite food: Strawberries
Favorite vehicle: All Types of Vehicles

Bulma is originally a secondary main character, but her role is quickly downplayed as the series continues, even though she does remain an important support character for most of the series. Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name ""Buruma"" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word ""bloomers,"" which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.

Bulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.

Chi-Chi is the wife of Son Goku, and the mother of Son Gohan and Son Goten. She is often depicted as a sometimes nagging, overprotective but fundamentally well-meaning woman, who sincerely looks for her children and husband's well-being even when their views clash. She and Goku meet as children, and Goku promises to marry her thinking marriage is food. Several years later, she finds him at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai, and despite confessing that he misunderstood what she had meant, he fulfills his promise and asks her to marry him. As she gets older, she disapproves of Goku's lifestyle, enough to ban Gohan from following in his foot steps, but due to the threats like Vegeta and Freeza, she is forced to let him train under Piccolo and Goku. She relaxes this with Goten by training him herself while Gohan is away for school. She has a wild temper and can react in violent anger over the slightest annoyance which means all of the Z Warriors fear her and try to avoid making her mad.

2094,Gyumao,牛魔王,Ox-King,"Gyumao is based on Niúmówáng (""Ox-Demon-King"", ""Ox Devil Lord"" or ""Ox Tyrant"") a character from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. 

Despite his threatening name, he is really quite harmless and fun-loving; given that gyū is the crest on his helmet, it is incorrectly assumed by fans that Gyū is his surname and Maō is his first. He was somewhat demonic and frightening when his castle became engulfed in flames on Frypan Mountain. 
He wreaked havoc through the village at the foot of the mountain, threatening anyone he presumed would steal his treasure, until Kamesen'nin showed him the error of his ways. He is Chichi's father and thus Son Goku's father-in-law. Gyumao is very strong and trained alongside Grandpa Son Gohan under Muten-Rôshi's tutelage. 

As the series progresses, Gyūmaō's role lessens in the story and eventually fades into being a background character, used only for slight comic relief. Gyumao is also the grandfather of Gohan and Goten. In anime filler, he has a few large roles though from time to time, mainly accompanying his family and the others.

Karin is a deity just below the rank of Kami, and plays a large role in Dragon Ball when he trains Goku during the Commander Red Saga to defeat Tao Pai Pai. At later points in the series and in Dragon Ball Z, Karin lends his assistance periodically to Goku and the other characters by growing them Senzu, which only grow in a tree in his tower.

He is voiced in the original Japanese version by Ichirō Nagai and then later by Naoki Tatsuta.

One of the most powerful and talented Human martial artists on Earth, Krillin is courageous, a faithful ally and good-natured. He is a prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies.

1012,Majin Buu,魔人 ブウ,Djinn Boo,"Buu is introduced in the series during the Buu Saga as an innocent looking pudgy pink genie-like creature. Later in the series, it is revealed that Boo's original form is a more sleek child form (""The Boo of Pure Evil""), however his nature and form had been altered after he'd assimilated the gentle, pudgy god (Dai kaioshin) into his body. Buu's creator, a wizard named Bibbidi, had used Boo to wage war on the Kaioshin. Buu managed to assimilate two of the four Kaioshin, the second being the one who altered his nature to become innocent. Before assimilating the second Kaioshin, he had killed the third Kaioshin. After Bibbidi sealed buu away, Bibbidi was killed by the fourth Kaioshin, and Boo was transported to planet Earth where he layed dormant for five million years until he was revived by Bibbidi's son Babbidi during the events of Dragon Ball.

Buu has numerous counterparts in the series. When he first emerges from his shell, he is tall and round, and his personality is naive and innocent. The first form of Buu kills Babidi, however soon befriends a human named Mr. Satan, and later a puppy which Buu finds and heals after he'd decided to go on a killing rampage. After realizing that the puppy liked him, Boo names the puppy Bay (Bee in English). Despite Boo's sudden change of heart, two gunmen destroy his house and attempt to kill Bay and Mr. Satan. Due to his rage at the gunman, Boo's anger manifests itself in the form of another Buu (""The Buu of Pure Wrath"").

After a battle with the superior Buu of Pure Wrath, Buu is absorbed and the two combined create Super Buu, who tracks down the protagonists of the series Piccolo and Gotenks. After absorbing them, Buu is faced by another character named Son Gohan. After absorbing Son Gohan, Buu is confronted by the character Vegetto, where he is forced to separate from all the characters at which he'd absorbed, including the Good Bu. As a result, he reverts to his purest form, the original child state called ""The Buu of Pure Evil.""

Mr. Popo is an excellent martial arts master. When he is introduced in Dragon Ball, his fighting prowess is far superior to Goku's in nearly all respects, when the two meet at the Lookout.

Mr. Popo and Kami train Krillin, Tien Shinhan, Yamcha, Chiaotzu and Yajirobe in order to help combat the approaching threat of the Saiyans, through many different training methods, including the Pendulum Room, intending to show the full power even the lower class Saiyans used to possess.

Muten-Rôshi trained Grandpa Son Gohan, Ox King, Son Goku, Kuririn, and Yamcha. His home, Kame House, a shack on a small isolated island, serves as a gathering place for the Z Fighters and friends. He is a stock character, as he is both the archetypal wise old man and dirty old man, the latter being typical of shōnen anime. Sometimes he gets cranky, which further provides comic relief. He is bald, with a thick goatee and a thick mustache. Muten-Rôshi wears beach clothes or a martial arts suit and a turtle shell on his back. He usually wields a walking stick. His companions are usually Oolong, Umigame and Lunch.

Piccolo is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball metaseries. He is considered both the son and reincarnation of Demon King Piccolo and was spawned to save himself from certain death at the hands of Son Goku. Like his father, he appears as a tall green humanoid creature with pointy ears; he is later revealed to be part of an alien race known as the Namekians.

Piccolo is first consumed with revenge against Goku, and elects to defeat and kill him during the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. After his narrow defeat against Goku, Piccolo is soon forced to form an at first uneasy alliance with Goku and his friends against newer, more dangerous threats like the Saiyans and Freeza. Out of necessity he also takes it upon himself to train Goku's child Son Gohan, forming a bond which is strengthened when he sacrifices himself to save the child's life against Nappa. After his resurrection, he fully joins Goku and the others in their struggles against ever more powerful villains.

Piccolo still retains elements of ruthlessness and cockiness, but once he fuses with Kami, all traces of evil and hate disappear, and Piccolo is completely reborn as a pure soul. Piccolo remains a loner, preferring to stand apart from others. He has little to say unless it involves battle, but he normally can still retain his stoic and calm personality in everyday, normal situations. Piccolo has shown to have intelligence, such as when he gathered strength to regenerate his arm after Cell had drained it, or when he elected to kill Babidi since he knew leaving him alive wouldn't solve the problem of Buu. His intelligence is even picked up on Buu, who later absorbs him for his fine brain.

Piccolo's character development entails him changing from a villain hell-bent on revenge on Goku and controlling the world to becoming a better person who is capable of caring about other people, like Gohan and Goku. He's also showed some interest in learning about his Namekian heritage, and has a good affinity with kids, as he trained Gohan for a year, helped Goten and Trunks to learn Fusion
and is even seen humorously rocking Pan to sleep in Fukkatsu no F. He also acts as a confidant for Dende, who is a younger Namekian and is tasked with watching over Earth (Piccolo is able to impart the wisdom he gained from fusing with Kami, as Kami was the previous placeholder of Dende's current occupation).

677,Pu'ar,プーアル,Puar|Pu'erh|Squeaker,"Pu'ar is a soft-spoken shapechanging blue creature and the constant companion of Yamcha. The name is revealed to be a pun on Pu-erh tea. Pu'ar is neither a cat or a mouse, albeit the series creator Akira Toriyama stated that he had drawn the character to look a little bit like a cat. Traveling alongside Yamcha, the two worked as a team robbing anyone traveling through the desert area in which they lived. Pu'ar has an innate ability of levitation or flight, and is nearly always seen simply 'standing' in thin air at about human head height.

Pu'ar has the unique ability to shapeshift into any form, even inanimate objects, and can hold that form for as long as desired; though strength is not increased by the change, however, as such is unable to turn into something that can be used up like fuel or food. Pu'ar graduated from the same shapeshifting academy as Oolong, although unlike Oolong, Pu'ar had completed all of the academy training and does not have Oolong's difficulties with maintaining a transformed state. Pu'ar shows up quite a bit in the beginning, but becomes less of a presence as the series continues. As the driving theme of the series is mostly about fighting, Pu'ar can do little more than react to the horrors of the latest supervillains in the story.

There is some debate regarding the character's gender. Despite being portrayed by several female voice actors, the character has been referred to with both male and female pronouns during the anime. Though the issue of gender is never directly addressed, Toriyama has referred to Pu'ar as ""he"" while answering a fan question in the ""Ask Me Anything"" section in the back of the manga. Some fans believe that since shape-shifters can assume many different forms, gender is a moot point.

6127,Shen Long,神龍,Shinryuu|Shenron,"Shen Long is the wish granting dragon (神龍 Kami Ryuu, God Dragon) of Earth. The Shen Long of the Black Star Dragon Balls is red, opposed to the Shen Long of Earth who is green.

Shen Long can be summoned by gathering all seven of the Dragon Balls of Earth. Shen Long can bestow any wish as long as it does not exceed the power of his creator, who must be still alive (i.e. Kami or Dende). Multiple times in the Dragon Ball series, Shen Long threatens to kill the summoner if they do not say a wish on time, or if they do not say a wish at all. Shen Long cannot bring back a person from the dead more than once. The Dragon Balls cannot be used for 365 Earth days after a wish is made, as they turn to stone. The Earth Dragon Balls are relatively small, each about the size of a large orange, much smaller than the namekian Dragon Balls, which are the size of beach balls.

The base for Shen Long is a stone statue kept by his creator. If Shen Long is killed, the Dragon Balls turn to stone. The statue also shatters. If the creator or another Namekian wishes to, they can rebuild the statue to give life back to Shen Long and the Dragon Balls. This happened after Shen Long granted Piccolo Daimao's wish for youth.

While Kami and Piccolo weren't merged, Shen Long could only grant one wish. After Dende brought him back to life, he was able to grant two wishes (three if the first does not revive more than one at a time). If the summoner wants, he can only make one wish. This makes the Dragon Balls turn to stone for only six months.

Goten is a fictional character in the manga and anime series Dragon Ball Z, as well as appearing in Dragon Ball GT. He is the second son of Son Goku and Chi Chi. Goten is a Human-Saiyan hybrid, just like his older brother Son Gohan.

Son Goten's natural physique almost perfectly replicates his father Goku's, even though his appearance such as hair style and clothes change from time to time. Goten is generally seen wearing an outfit that mimics his father's, with only slight differences. As in the case of the last few episodes of Dragon Ball Z, his hair has grown long, no longer looking like his father's he also wears a blue and white shirt with his name printed on it. In Dragon Ball GT, he wears a white shirt with purple jeans, and his hair is much shorter. His skin color stays lightly tanned for all of his appearances in Dragon Ball Z/GT. Goten, unlike his brother, was never shown to have a tail. This is never explained.

In Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, and unlike Dragon Ball GT, Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story), it is stated that in 800 Age, Goten, along with Present Day Trunks had created the Kikoukenjutsu Sword School

Gohan is the dual main character of Dragon Ball Z along with his father, Gokuu.

Gohan is a shy and studious intellectual, and as a child lacks the fighting spirit that is common among most Saiyans. However, because he is forced to protect the ones he loves, he taps into his vast half-breed Saiyan potential, becoming one of the most powerful main characters in the series. As an adult, he abandons his superhero duties and uses his mind, as a premier scholar. Gohan is extremely powerful, sometimes surpassing Gokuu, Piccolo, and Vegeta at certain points in the story.

At first, the relationship with Piccolo is a frightening one, but after Piccolo saves Gohan's life from Nappa at the cost of his own, Piccolo admits his change because of Gohan's acceptance of him during the one year they were training together. From here on out, Piccolo acts as an uncle (Oji-san in the Japanese version) to Gohan. Krillin also acted as a strong confidant in Gohan, particularly during the Namek arc and the beginning of the Buu arc.

Gohan also shares a strong relationship with his father in Gokuu, citing his walking up to Freeza on Namek as a source of inspiration and strength. He also spends close to a full year just with him in the Room of Spirit and Time during the Androids arc, and the two really get to enjoy each other's company. Gohan's respect and love for his father are all the more shown when he elects to wear Gokuu's orange gi when he sets off to fight Buu.

His hobbies are reading, fishing, and researching scholarly subjects. Though he claims he does not share the love of fighting Gokuu has, Gohan does feel obligated to help when danger arrives. He also enjoys being a hero, as seen by his comedic and unimpressive Great Saiyaman stunt. Another prominent facet of his personality was the fear of his own great potential power, which was seen when he was afraid that he might kill Cell during their battle in the Androids arc.

As a child during the Majin Buu arc, Trunks is shown to be quite cocky and stingy just like his father, as well as mischievous, most likely due to the fact that this Trunks grew up with his father Vegeta and enjoyed the luxuries of peace, while Future Trunks grew up without Future Vegeta and in an apocalyptic world, causing him to be much more serious and cautious. Trunks has a combination of both of his parents' personalities: cocky and proud like his father and spoiled and selfish like his mother.

In his later years, Trunks adopts a personality similar to his future counterpart's. During and in between his battles at the World Martial Arts Tournament, he acts just like his father does, calm when he fights and insulting his opponents.

Vegeta is a fictional character from the manga series Dragon Ball, created by Akira Toriyama.

Along with Goku, Gohan and Piccolo, he is one of the most prominent characters in the series, originally starting out as a villain before becoming a mainstay hero.

Vegeta starts out haughty, arrogant, self-entitled and ruthless as the prince of Saiyans. His royal status caused him to develop an inflated sense of superiority and he holds himself above most, if not all people he encounters. Regal, egotistical and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer. However, as the story unfolds, he changes to a person capable of caring about and loving someone other than himself.

Vegeta was once a young member of the Saiyan army, but after his race's demise, he worked alongside Nappa and Raditz, directly under Freeza. He seeks immortality to rule the universe, but once he learns about Freeza destroying his planet from Dodoria, he resolves to take out Freeza (not to avenge his race, but to assure his own rule over the universe as well as to get back at Freeza for unknowingly using him to further his own goals). He later battles Freeza with the main cast on Namek and dies in the ensuing fights; once he is revived, he returns to Earth, where he adjusts to everyday life and remains there for good.

In Cross Epoch (the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot) Vegeta is the captain of an air ship and is seen wearing an eye patch and a cape with a clasp featuring the Kanji character for ""vegetable."" Trunks, Usopp and Nico Robin are members of his crew.

Yamcha, the notorious desert bandit, started out as an antagonist of Goku but quickly became his friend thanks to Bulma. He lived in the desert, which resulted in him never having much female contact. Whenever he encountered Bulma, he would blush immensely and become petrified right on the spot.

Yamcha's trade mark move was known as the Fist of the Wolf Fang.
With this move, he would strike the opponent with his hands in a claw like pose with his middle finger, ring finger and thumb curled.

His best friend is a floating shift-shaping cat named Pu'ar.

Sagiri was taught to draw by her mother at a young age, and by the time she was around the age of nine, she became Masamune's illustrator. A year before the events of the novel, Sagiri met Masamune, though she didn't realize that he was the author she was working with despite the similar names. After her mother died, she temporarily stopped drawing and going outside. After seeing a live video of someone drawing images and getting a response, Sagiri became interested in live video feeds and started drawing images on a camera disguising her face and voice so that nobody would recognize her or learn about her. She eventually started to interact with people who saw her video feed (while still disguised). At some point, Masamune was too busy to cook and she chose to go hungry rather than go outside her room to get food.

Famous quote: ""I don't want to regret anything. I want to make all the tragedies that happened into meaningful things by believing that my path is right.""

Shirou is the main character of Fate/stay night. He is a serious yet helpful, hardworking, and honest teenager. His hobbies include fixing a variety of broken things, from VCRs to stoves, as well as cooking and cleaning. He has some slight talent with sorcery, though he was discouraged by his foster father Kiritsugu Emiya from improving his gifts. He is initially confused about the Holy Grail War and attempts to irrationally shield others from danger, including his own Servant, Saber.

Shirou is unskilled in most traditional forms of sorcery, and his only effective magic is Reinforcement, the power to analyze the structural composition of objects and increase their effectiveness by understanding their chemical and physical makeup, such as the sharpness and durability of a sword and shield. However, he lacks mastery for even this simple spell, and his various applications of it are limited.

Rin is a model student and idol of Shirou's school. She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is secretly a Magus and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. In the beginning of the anime, she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests.

Two centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization.

Rin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. After her father was killed, Rin continued to improve her sorcery with some guidance from Kirei Kotomine. To divert attention from her private life, Rin has diligently strived to earn the admiration of her peers, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a slacker.

The rights to the Toosaka lands were inherited by Aoi after Tokiomi's death, and subsequently inherited by Rin after Aoi's death. Kirei managed them as Rin's guardian, and because of his foolhardy and coarse management, the majority of profitable properties ended up in the hands of others. It is possible that he believed the wealth was bad for her upbringing due to following the principles of humility and poverty.

Although Rin resents the sacrifices she has endured for the sake of tradition, she is fiercely competitive and eager to prove herself as a skilled and capable magus. She was immensely disappointed at summoning Archer and ended up in a quarrel with him; however, the duo soon reconciled, set aside their differences and quickly got along.

He is the Servant of one of the series' main heroines, Rin Toosaka. Due to an incomplete summon, he apparently has no memory of his previous life or identity. Archer is sarcastic and cynical—but under his hardened exterior lies a complex and dark personality that unfolds throughout the story. Though skilled with ranged weapons, he can hold his own in melee combat. Archer considers Shirou Emiya's idealism to be weak and delusional, recognizing Shirou's mentality of ""wanting to save everyone"" as naive and impossible.

Shirou's foster father and his savior from the aftermath of the massive Fuyuki fire. During his lifetime, Kiritsugu was disillusioned with becoming a Hero of Justice, a defender of humanity who could save everyone. Although he feels he failed to do so, his efforts were a source of inspiration for Shirou.

Prior to his fateful meeting with Shirou, Kiritsugu was notorious as the ""Magus Killer,"" a freelancer who would hunt down heretical magi. Although he was a magus with Magic Circuits and abilities he was considered unorthodox in that he would utilize modern technology and weaponry along with his magecraft to track down and kill magi.

Although mentioned and seen in flashbacks in Fate/stay night, Kiritsugu is one of the main protagonists in its prequel Fate/Zero.

Due to his father, Norikata Emiya, fourth family head of the Emiya family and a magus who received a Sealing Designation, Kiritsugu lost his mother shortly after he was born. Father and son were on the run from the Mage's Association, and thus Kiritsugu spent his youth wandering around the world with his father.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/474826.jpg,16975,anime,33049

After Kiritsugu died, Taiga became Shirou's guardian and has been living with him for several years. Taiga and Shirou are very close, and she regards him as a younger brother.

She's initially distrustful of Saber, believing that ""some strange woman was trying to take Shirou from her"" as she put it. She becomes exasperated whenever a new girl appears at Shirou's house, thinking he stashes girls at his house. Taiga always shows up for breakfast and dinner at Shirou's house to have some of Sakura's cooking, and always saves some scraps from breakfast for her lunch.

He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era. He was an ultimate, transcendent being so divine as to be two thirds god and one third human, and no others in the world could match him. He was a despot possessing high divinity who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago. He was the King of Heroes who possessed all things in the world, whose tale is recorded in mankind's oldest epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which portrays Gilgamesh as a hero, destined to be king and achieve great feats, who is driven to meet his destiny, facing challenges together with his best friend Enkidu.

His title, King of Heroes, is not meant to call him a king who is a hero, but instead implies that he is the king over all heroes. He is mankind's oldest hero, the origin of all myths and model on which heroes are based, so his story is copied within the mythologies of all the countries of the world. The heroes of various myths are derived from his legend, so his Gate of Babylon possesses all of their Noble Phantasms. Though there are several heroes holding the title of ""King,"" the King of Knights and King of Conquerors, he is the only one in all of heaven and earth crowned with the title of ""King of All Heroes.""


In Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA, he's the Heroic Spirit sealed into the eighth Class Card. He manifests as his younger self due to Illya separating him from his shadow form half-way through his incarnation. While initially an adversary, he quickly becomes an ally to fulfill his objectives. Gilgamesh in his child form has a more easygoing attitude compared to his adult self. He asks Illya to call him Gil-kun.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/338672.jpg,15850,anime,33049

Famous quote: ""People cannot change the past. All we can do, is accept our own actions. If you still wish to be burdened by your sins, let it show in your future actions. It is your choice how to perceive something that has already happened.""

Kotomine Kirei is the overseer of the Holy Grail War and resides at the church on top of the hill. He is callous and sarcastic, but also quite knowledgeable. As the supervisor of the Grail War, it is his duty to uphold the rules of the Holy Grail War, cover up any incidents that might expose the War to the public, and give sanctuary to any Masters who drop out. Both Tohsaka and Shirou appear to detest him, though in truth they don't seem to dislike him too much. Despite the enmity between the Mage's Association and the Church, Kotomine is a member of both organizations, which is presumably the reason he was chosen to be be the overseer.

Kotomine plays an important role in the unfolding events in all three routes, but the route that features him most heavily is the final one, Heaven's Feel where he takes an active role early on.

5266,Touko Aozaki,蒼崎 橙子,Scarred Red,"Birthday: August 8
Blood Type: O
Height: 165 cm (5'5"")
Weight: 52 kg

Appearing as a puppet maker, Touko is actually an extremely powerful sorceress.

Aozaki Touko appeared initially as the sister of Aozaki Aoko in the publicly unreleased novel Mahoutsukai no Yoru, and made a later appearance in Kara no Kyoukai. In the animated movies of Kara no Kyoukai, she is voiced by Honda Takako, while Inoue Kikuko lent her her voice for the drama CDs.

In Kara no Kyoukai, she is shown as a puppet maker and occasionally as a designer of buildings. Together with Kokutou Mikiya, she runs a kind of detective agency (伽藍の洞, Garan no Dou) that only engages in cases with supernatural or abnormal elements. Touko does not share a particularly good relationship with her sister, yet the causes for this break are unknown.

She's a powerful Magus, and she's able to reproduce parts of a body that can be used instead of the lost part. While this would be nothing special, she can reproduce the part in such a perfect way that it comes close to the real one. The glasses Tohno Shiki wears were originally made by Touko. Her sister Aoko stole them from Touko and made them indestructible.

As a doll-maker, she received a Sealing Designation for creating a doll (body) that was an exact replica of her own body.

Touko has 20 Magic Circuits, which was a surprise to the Aozaki clan as the number of Magic Circuits in their line had been dwindling. Due to her formidable power, Mage's Association dubbed her with the Orange color (橙), which is close to the three primary colors. She wished to get the color Blue, but that title was taken by her sister Aoko.

Also known as the Wizard Marshall, Zelretch of the Jewel, and the Kaleidoscope. 
One of the five True Magicians. 
He also had a role as one of the Dead Apostle Ancestors, but because it was not relevant to the story of Fate, that part was cut.
A magus who was symbolized by gem stones. An eccentric old man who raged at evil with a passion, but laughed at do-gooders. 
He frequently took in pupils, but no mage house had emerged as successors to take over his mantle. 
Once upon a time, he engaged the King of Vampires in single combat. He pushed back a boulder falling from the heavens in a feat of power. Such a monster was Zelretch. 
However, since then he had aged significantly. It seemed that he could no longer wield Magic the way he did, back when he was at his prime. 

Fate/Stay Night: Heavens Feel
Zelretch appears before Rin Tohsaka at the Clock Tower after she manages to recreate his Jeweled Sword with the assistance of Shirou Emiya during the Heaven's Feel route, complimenting her accomplishment by taking her as a protege and having the charges against her nullified. He had expected the least out of Nagato's unremarkable bloodline, ruminating on the progression of the Tohsaka family in just six generations. In the True End, he uses his influence in the Clock Tower to get Rin acquitted of opening and closing the gate of the Greater Grail.

He makes a brief cameo appearance in Carnival Phantasm.

In Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma illya Zelretch is the creator of Magical Ruby and Magical Sapphire. He gives them to Rin and Luvia so they can retrieve the Class Cards. He appears briefly conversing with Waver Velvet/Lord El Melloi II.

Height: 140 cm

The main female character of the story. Victorique has the appearance of a small, almost doll-like, girl with long golden hair and emerald eyes and a voice that sounds exactly like that of an older woman. It is mentioned once that she is 15 years old. Another important part of Victorique's appearance is a pipe that she smokes when thinking about something. She spends her days at the conservatory at the top of the library, reading several difficult books, often in different languages, simultaneously. She points at one wall of the library and has told Kazuya that she has read almost all the books over there. Along with her sharp tongue, abusive bluntness and eccentric attitude, she possesses amazing detective skills.


She enjoys ""reconstructing chaos"" and often complains of the boredom that causes her headaches. Victorique also seems to love sweets, since she's always really happy when Kujo gets her anything sweet.

Note: The character's name is Victorique. This was shown in the 9th episode. Her name was written at the top of a letter, and it clearly said ""Victorique"" and not ""Victorica.""

The main character of the story. As the youngest son of a soldier, Kazuya has spent most of his life struggling with living in his highly successful siblings' shadows. Jealous of all the attention his brothers got, he worked hard to compete, but everything changed when he understood that adults, who think that the youngest child is always spoiled and useless, will never acknowledge his efforts. With a permanent scar in his heart he left the military academy in Japan and before anyone from his family could stop him, went to study abroad to St. Marguerite. Unfortunately, his appearance, combined with the student body's belief that ""the traveler who comes in the spring brings death with him"" has resulted in Kazuya being called the ""Reaper"" and having no friends. By some twist of fate he becomes a messenger and companion to the most eccentric pupil in the school, Victorique. At first he didn't like Victorique because of her arrogant attitude, but after some time he started to care for her and be protective of her. He is described, by Victorique, as a good and sincere person whose soul is pure and beautiful enough to admit pride.

Kazuya tries to get him to tell it to Victorique, which he ignores. Victorique tells Kazuya to chat with the detective, that she will just read her books; if she says anything to herself, pay no attention. This is because he is Victorique's half brother and even if they are family they could never acknowledge each other in public.

Alice is a cute petit girl who is fluent in both English and Japanese (though it is mentioned that during Shinobu's homestay in England, the both of them communicated with each other only using the words, ""thank you"" and ""konnichiwa"").

Alice is very close to Shinobu and often tries to catch her attention, even to the point where she would try to one-up herself from Karasuma-sensei so Shinobu could see that Alice's English is better than Karasuma's.

She also has a fondness for playing detective when faced with such anomalies as Miyako's apartment. She tends to get upset when Miyako refers to her as having masculine qualities. She also gets very uncomfortable when asked about her love life, frequently inventing a history for herself that even cursory examination would show to be absurd, while blushing furiously.

He is the son of a famous and extremely wealthy artist, and recently moved to Hinamizawa after an array of unfortunate and awful events in his hometown. As a charismatic, lively attitude, and his talented tongue allow him to quickly fit in the town and make new friends, and also win some club activities. When in need of a weapon, he wields Satoshi's old bat. Keiichi often receives the butt of the jokes in the club's activities from which he was the correct answer to some games they play, to wearing embarrassing costumes whenever he loses punishment games.

Keiichi has brown hair with dark blue eyes and is described as charismatic to others.

Hobbies: collecting cute things, obsessing over cute things, treasure hunting
Famous quote: ""Friends. Those companions you speak of are only friends during those fun, yet unimportant times. When painful times come, they won't be your ally.""

Rena is the main female protagonist of the question arcs and a girl who returned from Ibaraki to Hinamizawa one year ago, she is in the same grade level as Keiichi.

She is very kind and takes care of Keiichi whenever possible, but is also naïve and is usually subject to light teasing by Keiichi, it is hinted later in the series that she loves him. She is distinguished by her obsession with things she perceives as adorable calling them kaaii (かぁいい, a slurred form of kawaii (かわいい), meaning ""cute""), which are usually moekko characters or items she finds while scouring the local dump. Generally, these things are not considered cute by others.

She also utters the phrase hau (はぅ) when excited or flustered, and has a habit of repeating phrases at the ends of her sentences, most famously ""kana? kana??"" (かな? かな??, lit. ""I wonder, I wonder?"").

Every now and then, she goes treasure hunting in the town's trash heap, searching for ""cute"" things to collect, and whenever she sees something that grabs her attention, she proclaims, ""I wanna take it home!"" (お持ち帰り, Omochikaerī) and proceeds to try and do so, becoming virtually unstoppable during these intervals.

When in ""Take it Home"" mode, she comically becomes stronger and faster. Despite this disarming trait, Rena is shown to be amazingly observant and perceptive about the things around her (in Watanagashi-hen, she was able to deduce that both Rika and Satoko went to the Sonozaki house by looking through the contents of their fridge and a flier).

According to Mion, while Rena might seem cute herself, people should be careful not to anger her as she becomes quite scary when angered.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/264395.jpg,6177,anime,934

She acts like a tomboy, and calls herself oji-san (meaning old man), but has a hidden girlish side. She is next in line to be the head of the Sonozaki household, one of the Three Families which holds tremendous influence in Hinamizawa. She is often seen with a holstered airsoft gun, even though she is never seen using it, and was removed in the PS2 adaption of the game; she is, however, very adept in the use of martial arts.

Mion also serves as leader of the after-school club consisting entirely of the main characters. She organizes a variety of strategy-based games for the members to play with penalties for any losers. Penalties usually involve wearing embarrassing or frilly outfits on the way home. Each game she organizes involves bending the general rules or using questionable and crude methods to win such as playing cards with a marked deck or using feminine wiles to discourage opposition.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/442810.jpg,2211,anime,934

In spite of all this, she and Mion maintain a close relationship. In most of the arcs, she is at a different school from the other main characters, and therefore appears less frequently.

She works as a waitress at the Angel-Mort restaurant and is the manager's assistant for the Hinamizawa Fighters little league team.

3128,Hanyuu,羽入,Hainiryuun Ieasomuuru Jieda|Promising Newcomer,"Birthday: August 1

Hanyuu is the mysterious ""transfer student"" in Matsuribayashi-hen. She has a pair of dark colored horns on her head, one of which is chipped slightly (however, no one seems to notice or mention them, with the exception of Takano, who calls her a ""monster""). 

In fact, she has appeared to Rika all her life, but only in Matsuribayashi-hen and Miotsukushi-hen did she gain the power to interact with others, posing as a distant relative of Rika's and given the name ""Hanyuu Furude."" Like many of the characters, she can be frightening when angered, and with her spirit-like nature, her appearance can change with her mood until she takes a physical form.

She is very meek and often makes the noise ""Au au, au au…"" when she is nervous or uncomfortable, or sometimes while trying to make a point. She also tends to end her sentences with nano desu (なのです?, lit. ""it is so""). 

She dislikes alcohol and kimchi, which Rika imbibes in large amounts as punishment when she finds Hanyuu annoying (as both Hanyuu's and Rika's senses are linked together). She mentions that she is a ""being above humans"" after being sacrificed to atone for the sin of humans, while both Rika and Takano describe her as a kind of deity. 

Rika refers to her as ""Oyashiro"" when talking with others (evident from Shion's chat with Rika in Meakashi-hen) but does not personally think of her as Oyashiro; instead, she sees her as a close friend. 

In Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei, Hanyuu tells Rika that she was sacrificed to atone for the sins of the people of the village, and Hanyuu asked Ōka Furude (Hanyuu's own daughter and Rika's ancestor) to kill her and then make the village a better place.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/451009.jpg,1258,anime,41006

Birthday: August 21
Likes: Dried plum black tea, getemono, spicy things
Dislikes: Boredom, 
Famous quote: ""When they're alive, you can enjoy watching them struggle. When they're dead, you can enjoy tearing out their guts. Tales are things you get to enjoy twice.""

Frederica Bernkastel is known as the Witch of Miracles. It is said that she resides in a world where concepts such as fate and probability can be visualized. Despite this, she has a pretty twisted personality and described herself as the ""cruelest witch in the world.""

Unlike other witches she has lifeless eyes. She appears to see Beatrice's game to solve her boredom, and unable to stand seeing the player getting tortured by Beatrice's game, she assists the player by giving some hints around the workings of the game. Her ""Magic of Miracles"" allows her to reset a desperate situation as long as the probability of a favorable situation is not equal to zero (Similar to Hanyuu's power to reset time).

She wants to defeat Beatrice, regardless of the means used for this objective. Throughout Umineko no Naku Koro ni, she maintains an icy and aloof calm in most situations, though by the end of Alliance of the Golden Witch and throughout Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru, she is shown to be just as impish and playfully cruel as Lambdadelta.

Number of piercings: 9 (4 for each ear and 1 on the lip)
Parents: Miyamura, Naozumi (father) and Miyamura, Iori (mother)

In school, he gives off an impression of a quiet, anti-social guy. Usually assumed to be an otaku with good studying capabilities, Miyamura is soon to be viewed as a good friend to both Kyouko and her closest friends. Despite the weather, Miyamura tries to cover up as much as possible in order to hide his tattoos and leaves his long hair loose to cover up his piercings. This image briefly changes once he leaves school, particularly at Kyouko's house. Once he is outside of school, he removes his blazer and necktie and wears his hair up which visibly shows his multiple ear piercings. He also enjoys getting lattes from Starbucks and does not mind wearing short sleeves that show off part of his tattoos. Unlike most characters that wear glasses, Miyamura does very poorly in his studies, only managing to score full marks in P.E and average (or below) in all other classes. Although usually having trouble pronouncing certain Japanese words, he is very good at tongue twisters.

Seita watches them carry her away. She is then cremated in a huge fire with many other bodies.

Chitanda is a calm and happy person, but can become very excited when new or interesting things happen, especially when it involves her club.

She is the single daughter of the Chitanda Family, one of the four remaining wealthy farming families of the area, according to Satoshi. She joined the Classics Club due to ""personal reasons,"" and is the president of the club due to it not retaining any members from the previous year. She likes mysteries and has a great curiosity, which often drags Houtarou into solving them.

Oreki is a high-schooler with messy brown hair and green eyes. Due to his very lazy lifestyle, he almost always has a tired or bored look on his face. His hair is especially very messy when he wakes up.

He is shown to be a quiet student, and never concerned about things that happen around him. Despite being shown as an average high school student, he is quite intelligent and perceptive. The reason for his usual laziness is because he wishes to ""save energy."" Even though he is shown to be quite lazy, he never leaves his homework undone, as pointed out by Satoshi. He's considered lazy and apathetic, always living on the ""gray"" side, and is not interested in any activities that might waste his time and energy. He actually never intended to join any club, but his sister ordered him to join the Classics Club to save it from being disbanded. Even though he might not seem it, he's unbelievably good at solving mysteries and seems to be able to always find a solution if he gives it a thought.

Favourite food: Gateau au Chocolat (rich layered chocolate cake).
Subjects she is good at: All subjects. She is always in the top 10 among all students of her grade.
Subjects she is bad at: No subject in particular.
Physical activity: Good at sports.
Way to pass the time when alone: Studying.
Weaknesses and dislikes: Scary stories. Stories about pain.

Mio is a shy girl who is in the light music club. She plays a left-handed, 3-Color Sunburst Fender Jazz Bass with a tortoiseshell pickguard, though is shown playing a Fender Precision Bass in the first manga volume. She uses D'Addario EXL160M medium bass strings. Her bass is given the name Elizabeth later in the anime. While she originally intended to join the literary club, she was forced into the light music club by her childhood friend and the club's president/drummer, Ritsu. She gets excellent grades in school and is often mature and strict especially where Ritsu is involved; her weakness is the macabre and horrific, and she is often incapacitated with fear when stories involving ghosts, blood, injuries, haunted houses, barnacles or other disturbing topics come up. She also has a fear of being in the spotlight and gets embarrassed easily, and is often subject to teasing from Ritsu and Sawako, their club adviser and eventual third-year homeroom teacher. Mio has long, straight black hair and gray eyes (that are angled slightly more than the other characters). She cites that she chose bass since it is not the center of attention in the band, unlike the guitarist. Mio is more technical when it comes to music, and Yui often comes to her when she is in need of more guitar tutorials.

Along with Yui, Mio is one of the band's main vocalists, though given her dislike of being center stage, she tries to avoid taking the lead vocal if possible, generally singing if Yui is unable to. She writes most of the songs, although they usually feature some odd and overly girlish lyrics like ""Light and Fluffy Time."" As she is left-handed, she becomes entranced whenever she sees left-handed instruments, because of their rarity. After their first live performance, the attractive Mio gained a huge fan following (in no small part due to an unfortunate accident that occurred at the end of the show), led by an infatuated former student council president. Also resulting from her sudden popularity, most of her classmates voted that she portray Romeo in their class play. Mio comes to greatly enjoy her time at university as she encounters many new experiences. She is also able to overcome some of her shyness and make new friends such as Sachi and Ayame.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/48547.jpg,13504,anime,5680
19565,Yui Hirasawa,平沢 唯,,"Height: 156 cm
Weight: 50 kg
Blood Type: O
Sign: Sagittarius
Birthday: November 27
Age: 15-18

Favorite Music: Yui doesn't follow any particular style, and isn't picky. As long as she likes it, anything is OK.
Experience with musical instruments: Castanets
Family Structure: Family of four, both parents and younger sister (Ui). Father works for a trading company, gets a lot of overseas assignments and tends to be absent. Because the mother often travels overseas too (helping the father), the daughters have many opportunities to spend time alone together.
Dwelling: Single family detached home.
Commute to school: Walking.
Preferences in clothing: Pants over skirts. Yui is relatively fashion conscious and likes styles featured in teen magazines. She also wears casual clothes such as shorts and T-shirts at home.
Her room: Clean, because Ui cleans it. Yui likes small cute things, and keeps stuffed toys and such in her room. The room is painted in girly pastel and pink tones.
Favorite food: Anything, as long as it's sweet and delicious.
Subjects she is good at: Between low and average and can rarely pass test easily, but has a hard time with questionnaires.
Subjects she is bad at: All of them
Physical exercise: She can do it, but hates getting tired.
Way to pass time when alone: Lazing around at home.
Weaknesses and dislikes: Studying.

Main character, guitarist, lead vocalist. Having misunderstood that ""light music"" equals ""easy music"" (like whistling), she joined the Light Music Club and picked up guitar with absolutely no prior experience. She is the type of person who doesn't read manuals and relies on her own intuition and self-taught approaches. 

Yui is the lead guitarist and split vocalist of the Light Music Club who plays a Heritage Cherry Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Standard electric guitar that she nicknames ""Gīta"" (ギー太). Before she learned how to play the electric guitar, the only instrument she knew how to play was the castanets. She gets poor grades in school (though when properly coached, she can achieve astounding results), spaces out frequently, and is easily distracted by trivialities (mainly those she deems cute). Yui is a kind and friendly girl who holds no ill-will towards anyone. Yui has shoulder-length, brown hair (a little longer than Ritsu's) which she accessorizes with two yellow hair clips, and brown eyes. She has a huge liking for sweets and consumes them frequently (though she never gains weight, which is greatly envied by Mugi, Mio, and Sawako). She has a younger sister named Ui, who is very mature and acts as the ""older sister"" of Yui, taking care of her while their parents are away on business trips. Despite her difficulties with distractions, Yui works extremely hard to get better at playing guitar. During performances, Yui plays with amazing energy and joy which usually results in great response from the audience.

As a musician, Yui has absolute pitch—she can tune her guitar perfectly without a tuner, which greatly impresses Azusa, who possesses far more experience with playing guitar than Yui. She has a very easy-going nature, but has incredible focus and retention when she has a clear goal in sight. Yui is still devoted to her band and will always practice hard enough for the club. At school, she has become quite admired for her great voice. However, she has been shown to forget her lyrics mid-performance on at least one occasion and exert herself too much, making her unable to perform sometimes. Mio was the lead vocalist at first, since Yui could not play the guitar and sing at the same time.

Weight: 53kg
Blood type: O
Age: 16-18

Favorite Music: Classical music.
Experience with playing musical instruments: Started playing piano at age four. Picked up keyboard upon joining the Light Music Club.
Family structure: Family of three, both parents. Father is a president of a company. There is a butler at the house. She is being treasured as the only daughter.
Dwelling: Single-family home, a rather stately mansion.
Commute to school: By train (she lives two train stops away from the school). Because being driven to and from school by car is embarrassing for her, she avoids it.
Preferences in clothing: Skirts over pants. High society lady styles, such as elegant one piece dresses.
Her room: Canopy bed, antique furniture and such, as expected of a rich girl's room. The room is decorated mostly according to her parents' tastes.
Favorite food: She prefers traditional sweets such as daifuku (rice cakes with red bean jam filling) because she worries about calories and because western sweets are brought to her house all the time and she is tired of them.
Subjects she is good at: If anything, humanities, though she is also above average at science and math. While she is a little weaker than Mio when it comes to math, her math skills are certainly above her grade level.
Subjects she is bad at: No subject in particular.
Physical activity: Tsumugi is gentle and quiet and as result she is not good at ball games and track-and-field athletics. However, she has a lot of arm strength and amazing hand grip. She is a very strong girl.
Way to pass the time when alone: Elegant teatime
Weaknesses and dislikes: She is a little worried about her predisposition to gain weight easily.

    Tsumugi, often referred to as 'Mugi' by her friends, is a wealthy girl with a gentle and sweet personality who plays a Korg Triton Extreme 76-key keyboard, though she is also seen playing a Korg RK-100 keytar in the closing credits of the first season. She originally intended to join the choir club, but joins the light music club instead after receiving an invitation and encouragement from both Mio and Ritsu.Tsumugi is considered a piano prodigy since she has been playing the piano since she was four and has experience in winning various piano contests. Mugi has long, pale blonde hair, blue eyes, unusually large eyebrows, which apparently run in her family and a fair complexion that the other characters do not have, but she does not get sunburned. She is the daughter of a company president, and her family has several villas in various places around Japan (and even one in Finland). Since her father also owns a maid café, she often brings confectionery and an assortment of sweets and pastries to the club room, and she diligently makes tea with a tea set which is kept in their club room. Despite her wealth, she is fascinated by and finds joy in ""normal"" activities, such as ordering fast food, sharing french fries with her club mates, holding down part-time jobs and haggling over prices. Tsumugi displays a rebellious streak occasionally, diverting from her normally well-behaved and mature demeanor to the surprise of the others. She also displays a childlike eagerness from time to time, and possesses unusually high strength, being able to effortlessly carry around her own keyboard, Ritsu's drums, amplifiers, and at one point beating an arm-wrestling game in an arcade.

    Tsumugi is often entranced by the sight of two girls interacting closely together, sometimes imagining something more risqué in her head. The series sometimes indicates that Mugi has a crush on their teacher, Sawako Yamanaka. While a lot of things do not bother her, she is fairly conscious about her weight (just like Mio), and she gets a bit anxious when her family's staff start spoiling her friends during villa visits. She later begins learning how to play the guitar from Azusa. Tsumugi has a childhood friend several years younger than her named Sumire Saitō who is a daughter of the family that serves the Kotobuki household. Tsumugi grew up home schooled, and therefore spent very little time in the outside world. Because of their close friendship Sumire would purchase everyday items like manga for Tsumugi that she was not normally allowed to see. Tsumugi was rather taken by some of the yuri manga she received which may have influenced her later perceptions about relationships. When Sumire started high school, Tsumugi wanted her to experience the light music club on her own, but due to Sumire's shyness Tsumugi came up with the excuse to send her to the club room to pick up the tea sets that had been left there and told Sawako when Sumire did join that it was okay to leave the tea sets there.

Blood type: AB
Favorite music: western music, jazz
Favorite food: cakes
Subjects she is good at: above average in all subjects
Subjects she is bad at: no subject in particular
Athletic ability: above average.

Weaknesses and dislikes: lax atmosphere of the Light Music Club.

Azusa is a new student who joins the Light Music Club as a rhythm guitarist. She plays a Fender Mustang MG69/MH/CAR electric guitar which she eventually names Muttan, but is also in possession of a Gibson Les Paul Custom 50th Anniversary Gold Top (as seen in episode 13). She is a self-proclaimed novice guitarist who has been playing the guitar since the fourth grade and whose parents play in a jazz band. She is in the same year and class as Yui's sister, Ui, and has quite a mysterious demeanor. She often finds herself bewildered by the tea parties and cosplaying aspects of the club when she would rather just practice, and is struck by how good the club's music sounds despite their problems and lack of practice. However, she has a certain weakness for cakes and can be calmed down rather easily, sometimes by just being petted. She is more serious than the other girls, and does not like to admit how she really feels; she could be described in part as a tsundere. She is constantly hugged by Yui and is nicknamed Azu-nyan after trying on a pair of cat ears and meowing.

In the band, she looks up to Mio the most due to her maturity and the fact that she is an experienced musician, even trying to give Mio chocolate on Valentine's Day. However, she sometimes unintentionally makes remarks concerning Mio's weaknesses, such as her weight. She also finds Mugi very beautiful, and envies her hair and large eyes, and later starts teaching her how to play guitar when the two are alone in the club room. Since joining, Yui comes to her for advice on playing guitar, as well as maintenance. She gets a tan extremely easily, once during their time at the beach and another during a music festival (even after applying sunscreen). As a result, she frequently gets sunburned as well. She gets lonely very easily, and often worries that everyone in the club will leave her, as they are one-year-older and eventually will graduate. Due to this, the rest of the girls buy her a turtle to look after, naming it Ton-chan.

She is interested in a wide range of genres without limiting herself to anything in particular. She started playing instruments in fourth grade of elementary school, which makes it about 5 years of experience. Her parents both play in a jazz band.

Outside of the band, she often hangs out with Ui and Jun whenever the other girls are busy. When the others graduate, she becomes the new Light Music Club president alongside Ui and Jun, who decide to join her. Together with two new members, Sumire and Nao, they form a new band called Wakaba Girls. During the Wakaba Girls' first summer training camp Azusa reveals to Sawako her belief that she is unable to act like a proper president for the Light Music Club; however, Sawako suggests that there is no proper way to define what it means to be a president and that Azusa will do just fine. While on that same training camp Azusa is convinced by the others to become the band's vocalist despite her prior reservations on the issue, and eventually overcomes her weakness to sing in the school festival.

Her preference in clothing includes pants over skirts. Short pants are among the things she likes to wear. Her room is very tidy and not excessively cute.

Ritsu (or Ricchan, as nicknamed by Yui) is the self-proclaimed president of the light music club and plays a yellow Rick Marotta Signature Yamaha Hipgig drum kit with an add-on floor tom (in the opening credits only) combined with a cymbal set from Avedis Zildjian,though is shown playing a white Yamaha Absolute Series drum kit in the anime's closing credits.She has an ambiguous yet upbeat personality, much like Yui, but often has trouble remembering important club activities and announcements and gets constantly rebuked by Mio and Nodoka for forgetting to send in important forms concerning the club. Ritsu is cheerful, often likes making jokes and is sarcastic most of the time. She is skilled at brainstorming ideas that earn money for the club. Ritsu has shoulder-length, brown hair, with her bangs pulled back with a yellow hairband, and gold-colored eyes. She wears her school jacket open. She says she chose to play the drums because they are ""cool,"" but she then admits that she has trouble playing instruments which involve intricate finger movements, such as the bass, guitar and keyboard.

She is a childhood friend of Mio and will often take the opportunity to tease her whenever Mio is cowering from something. She is also known to become easily jealous of Mio's other high school friends, even going as far as spying on Mio when on outings with them. Ritsu is always on the go and will stop at nothing for the success of the light music club. Despite her rough mannerisms and speech, she gets cast as Juliet by the majority of her classmates in their class play rendition of Romeo and Juliet and, in the end, manages to act like a proper girl. In the anime, she states her favorite drummer is Keith Moon of The Who. She is skilled at cooking. She has a younger brother named Satoshi.

Ui is Yui's younger sister, who begins the story as a third-year junior high school student, but later enters Yui's high school the following year in the same class as Azusa. Unlike her older sister, Ui is mature, responsible and handles household chores well, though she still shares a strong relationship with Yui and has a great deal of love and respect for her older sister. Despite being a year younger than Yui, she is nearly identical to her with her hair down and is even once able to fool the club. She possesses some of her sister's musical gift, and has a great talent for playing the guitar—she became capable of playing with the rest of the light music club band after only a few days of practice (Yui was sick, so Ui dressed up as Yui to help the band out). She takes particularly good care of Yui and strives to look after her even at the risk of her own health. Ui is actually considered as the ultimate groupie for her sister's band and supports them with all her heart. She occasionally provides a narrative to the story. She is in the same class as Azusa and hangs out with her sometimes.

She shares the same class as Mio in their second year, who appreciates her companionship tremendously, as being the only person Mio knows in her class.

Sawako is the adviser for the wind instrument club at Yui's school. An alumna of the school and a former member of the light music club, she does not want people to know she was formerly a member of a heavy metal band, thus she covers up by being mild and gentle to her co-workers and especially to students. She is forced to be the adviser of the light music club, as Ritsu blackmails her after the girls learn of her past, though it is unknown whether she stopped being the adviser for the wind instrument club as the story progresses. Though she has a mature and gentle demeanor in the school, Sawako, affectionately addressed as ""Sawa-chan"" by both Ritsu and Yui, displays a totally different, completely authentic character when she is alone with the light music club. In reality, she is a rather wild, lazy and quite an irresponsible teacher who enjoys dressing up the light music club in, sometimes embarrassing, cosplay costumes, much to the dislike of Mio. She names the club band ''After School Tea Time'' after the members take too long deciding on a name themselves, and to maintain the secrecy on her heavy-metal image. She once momentarily pitches in for Yui with her Epiphone Flying V electric guitar.

He cannot leave others in trouble, and has a knack for finding those in trouble as well.

Chizuru Ichinose, alternatively known as Chizuru Mizuhara (水原 千鶴) in her ""rental girlfriend"" persona, is the main female protagonist of the Kanojo, Okarishimasu series.

She is a college student at Nerima University, majoring in Literature. As rental girlfriend, she is affiliated with Diamond, and thus a colleague of Ruka Sarashina and Sumi Sakurasawa. She formerly resided at Room 204 of Royal Hills Nerima, just next to Kazuya Kinoshita, before moving back to her home when the residence collapsed.

Chizuru has waist-length chestnut-brown hair, with a notable braid tied into a small ponytail hanging on the back (though it can appear to be on the left or right in most artwork) and light brown eyes.

Chizuru is a dazzling and stunning beauty that turns heads wherever she goes. She's described to have a large bosom, long slender legs, and almost ideal proportions. She is athletic and has pride in her fitness and appearance. In addition, she has an eye for fashion, which is reportedly inherited from her mother Kasumi Ichinose.

When posing as a diligent student, she wears glasses, a butterfly accessory and she sports double braided hair. In stark contrast to her activities off-campus, she dresses in an unassuming manner that hides her features, leaving her unnoticeable to those who do not know her real identity. It is later revealed that she does have sight trouble and she uses a pair of contact lenses when she is not going out with her friends.

At first glance, Chizuru comes across as very kind and considerate, which positively surprises anyone who considers renting, and makes them give high ratings to her. While her kindness is genuine, she is still prideful of her reputation, and can be a little irritable and brash when her ratings go down. She shows this side of her to people she dislikes or has to put up with, such as Kazuya Kinoshita.

Chizuru is described to be an ""iron lady,"" who has surrounded herself with an emotional wall that is almost impenetrable. Although she has friends before meeting Kazuya, and at first glance she easily comes across as outgoing and cheerful, she kept her personal life at a distance.

Underneath all her pragmatic and professional attitude, though, Chizuru is a genuinely kind-hearted person. She goes out of her way to assist Kazuya at great risk of her profession. Her kindness is also seen when she becomes friends with Sumi, and she helps her becoming better at her job.

Kazuya Kinoshita is the main male protagonist of the Kanojo, Okarishimasu series. He is a college student at Nerima University who is majoring in Business Administration. He lives alone in an apartment situated in 203 Royal Hills Nerima.

Kazuya is a young man of average height whose appearance is rather dull, he lacks anything that makes one stand out, he has messy spiky light brown hair as well as lackluster brown eyes.

His apparel consists of an orange t-shirt with a black spiral in the center, that is over long-sleeved black shirt and striped pants or jeans.

Kazuya is an indecisive man with a very low level of self-esteem. As a result, he end up compulsively lying to those around him without hesitation. His lies often get him into trouble, because he cannot muster the strength to tell the truth and he's very emotion-based, often acting irrationally and illogically which result unable stand up for himself and frequently jump to conclusion.

Mami Nanami is a minor antagonist of the Kanojo, Okarishimasu series. She is a freshman at Nerima University and the ex-girlfriend of Kazuya Kinoshita whom she dumped in favor of someone 'new', thus setting off the main events of the series.

Mami is a rather short young woman, with blonde hair styled in a bouncy bob that has subtle pink highlighted tips. She has bright blue eyes and a small frame with nice and slender legs.

Her daily outfit changes from time to time, but usually with light clothing, a purse and a skirt that flaunts her fair skin.

Mami is an attractive person, and is certainly aware of it, seeing as she uses it to her advantage. However, she can quickly become self conscious when she compares herself to more well-endowed women, such as Chizuru.

In contrast to her sweet and approachable appearance, Mami can exhibit a cold and frightening demeanor when disgruntled. In this state, she scares away men trying to flirt with her and even causes her friends to pause in bewilderment at her reactions.

In public, Mami appears to be a sweet and friendly person. Behind that persona, however, Mami has displayed sociopathic tendencies, such as conniving, manipulative, and petty behaviors, especially revolving around Kazuya and Chizuru. When her friendly facade drops, her jealous and possessive feelings scare people around her. Despite not being involved with Kazuya anymore, she has gone out of her way to get more information about him and the girls he's with and attempt to pull them apart. It is still unknown whether she does these out of lingering feelings for Kazuya, or if her motivations are simply out of spite.

Sumi Sakurasawa is one of the main female deuteragonists of the Kanojo, Okarishimasu series. She is a first-year college student and works as a rental girlfriend with Chizuru Ichinose's company, where she is a newcomer to the industry. She is also the protagonist of a spin-off series Kanojo, Hitomishirimasu.

Sumi exudes a soft and gentle appearance with reddish-pink hair that is braided on the right side and reddish-pink eyes. However, there is no consistency to her apparel, as she changes them depending on the chosen date.

Sumi is an extremely shy and timid individual who hardly ever speaks and when she does, it's only in a soft tone. This shows when she first met Kazuya Kinoshita and the consecutive times they spent their time together; only nodding, using facial expressions, and sign language as forms of communication.

On the other hand, she shows prolific amounts of determination, despite the communication barriers that hinder her social life, whether becoming a rental-girlfriend to change herself or mustering up the courage to find compromises to problems, like planning ahead of time to make sure things turn out well.

As expected of her introverted personality, she tends to overthink. Most of her monologue revolves around talking to herself and thinking of every possible scenario that could happen if she followed through with a decision.

Ruka Sarashina is a supporting character and occasional minor antagonist of the Kanojo, Okarishimasu series. She is a girl whose heart beats slower than the average person and she seeks a lover that will help her cope with her condition.

Ruka's most identifying features are her short black hair and blue eyes tied up with a ribbon, usually a blue one. With her ribbon off, her hair is a voluminous layered bob. She's often in her school uniform, which consists of a white button up with a tie, a blue blazer and a hiked up skirt. During her rental dates, she usually wears a turtleneck sweater with a variety of patterned short skirts. Her casual wear usually consists of sundresses, though she wears longer sleeved clothing and leggings when dressed up for conservative occasions.

Ruka has a womanly figure that belies her youthful appearance. Although she personally admits her figure isn't as filled out as Chizuru's, she is described as having a sizable bosom and long, slender legs. She is considered very attractive, often comparatively with Chizuru by the male characters, and tends to gather a lot of attention when in public.

Ruka is described to be a cheerful, determined, and passionate girl. She is a straightforward person who is honest with her feelings. On the flip side, her traits often convey her as being self-centered, pushy and possessive. This personality of hers developed after learning of her condition and being alienated from her peers. Because of this, she became very fixated on the idea that getting a boyfriend would help her in having a faster heartbeat.

Ruka's brash persona often leads to conflicts with Kazuya and, more specifically, Chizuru. On top of that, her determination can lead her to being stubborn to a fault. This often leads to her making poor decisions to get what she wants, and she will often throw tantrums or act out if things don't go her way.

Ruka is born with an irregular heartbeat, leading her life to be tormented for being treated differently from the others because she can collapse if she performs a hard working activity. This leads her to become a rental girlfriend as a wish to have someone who can make her heart beat faster without any trouble. For a while, all the people she met with had no effect on her, until she met one who was truly genuine during a coincidental meetup, Kazuya Kinoshita.

The sincerity of Kazuya made her fall in love with him and slowly led to her decision to quit her rental girlfriend job. She technically blackmails Kazuya into being her ""trial boyfriend"" under the condition that she does not reveal Chizuru's job and her relationship with Kazuya. Unfortunately, this causes her to become a thorn on Kazuya's side. To make the matter worse for Kazuya, she now works at the same job as him.

Eye Color: Red
Hair Color: Black (with two blue streaks)
Occupation: College Student, YouTuber/Streamer, Cosplayer
Affiliation: Nerima University

Mini Yaemori is a supporting character of the Kanojo, Okarishimasu series. She is a neighbor of Kazuya Kinoshita and Chizuru Ichinose who is also a YouTuber, and a streamer on Nicolive and Twitcasting.

Mini has a slim, petite build with a fairly prominent bosom. She has long black hair that reaches to her mid back, with two distinguishing blue streaks, straight cut bangs, and a small cowlick on the crown of her head. Another distinguishing feature is her protruding fang.

Mini loves to cosplay and dedicates her social media towards it, so her apartment room is packed full of clothes and accessories. When not cosplaying, Mini generally dresses comfortably in an oversized shirt and shorts, usually with a track jacket. In public, she dresses femininely.

Mini sports an optimistic and rather childish personality. She lets her curiosity get the best of her and will act on impulse. She also tends to get caught up in the moment and says things bluntly, even coming across as slightly rude.

In spite of this, she is a kind person who does show consideration towards others and promises not to delve deep into the endeavors of others unless necessary.

Yuuichi Aizawa is the main protagonist of Kanon. He is friendly and outgoing, and though as nice as of a person he is, he has yet to learn the sensitivity of women. He constantly teases the main cast of girls throughout the story which varies in severity depending on the girl. Despite this, he does have a soft side that likens him to an older brother as noted by Shiori Misaka. He used to visit the city in which the story takes place, but his memories of that time are gone, slowly coming back to him as he interacts with the people he met in the past. As noted by himself, he is afraid of heights.

While not aware of it at first, Yuuichi slowly begins to take notice in the supernatural events occurring within the city. During these times of revelation when he will discover something outrageous, he stays strong with the girls he has made close friendships with. Since Yuuichi is a normal person, he tries to help them anyway he can and will usually go out of his way in order to protect one or more of these girls.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/58384.jpg,546,anime,1530

Blood Type: B

Description:
Nayuki Minase is Yuichi's cousin, with whom he moves in with at the beginning of the story. She has always been in love with him (in Japan, such relationships between first cousins are legal and generally accepted) and must learn how to deal with these feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall for one of the other girls. She adores strawberry sundaes, but the mere mention of her mother's ""special"" homemade jam makes her sick.

Nayuki is a heavy sleeper, which has led her to collect dozens of alarm clocks; they do not work on her, but instead wake Yuichi every morning. Since she has such trouble waking up, she is always running for school and is in fact the school's star runner because of this. Similarly, she became the captain of the school's female track team despite being in her second year. She takes a long time to get up in the morning and will pass out several times during the morning before completely waking up. Despite her attempts to stay conscious, she still tends to fall asleep a lot in class.

Nayuki has a fondness for animals and never misses an opportunity to try to pet one, even wild animals, such as cats, dogs, or even the occasional fox if she can help it. Unfortunately for her, she is allergic to cats. One of her defining features is that she tends to talk slower than the rest of the characters. She will often state the obvious to Yuichi, such as when lunch break occurs or when school ends.

Nayuki is second to Ayu as the most used character in the series' marketing. Also, in both anime adaptations, her story runs at the same time as Ayu's.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/75628.jpg,383,anime,1530

Makoto is a character from the Japanese visual novel Kanon, voiced by Mayumi Iizuka. She is a young girl who attacked Yuuichi Aizawa out-of-the-blue in the middle of town early on in the story. She was then carried back to Yuuichi and Nayuki Minase's house, where she lived as a guest for the remainder of her story. Despite having lost her memories, she remembered what her name was and is sure of is that she holds a grudge against Yuuichi from the past when he visited the city back when he was younger. Makoto's amnesia, or memory loss, is much more severe than Yuuichi's or Ayu Tsukimiya's, but from an entirely different source. When it comes to her opinion on taking in small animals as pets, she feels sad that pets sometimes are abandoned when their owners cannot take care of them. Due to this attitude, it takes her a while to warm up to a stray cat she finds halfway through her story which she later names Piro. Makoto is shown to love Piro very much and will often carry the cat around on her head. 

From early on, it becomes obvious that Makoto has a mischievous personality, which leads to her performing various pranks. These are done exclusively on Yuichi because of her strong dislike for him, something she constantly reaffirms. Her persistent attempts at pranks on Yuuichi vary in severity, such as simply dropping food on him or once even throwing lit firecrackers in his room. As time passes and Makoto beings to feel more as a member of the Minase family rather than a stranger, she honestly grows to like Yuuichi, effectively looking beyond her latent distaste for him. 

Makoto can be clueless about things that people her age should know, such as the fact that she can buy her own meat buns and manga; Yuuichi had commented once how she lacked common sense due to a lack of social experience. Like Ayu, she too has an idiosyncratic expression, ""auu~"", which she says when she is frustrated or sad; likewise, it has no real meaning. Another unique speech pattern of hers is that she always refers to herself in the third person. Near the end of her story, Makoto starts to wear two bells around her right wrist and enjoys the sound they make.

Sayuri cares very deeply about Mai, as it shows since they not only hang out together constantly, but Sayuri will get worried if Mai is in trouble; she also never forgets Mai's birthday. Initially, she is completely ignorant about the demons but even though some begin to target her near the end of Mai's story, she stubbornly stays by Mai's side.

320,Akiko Minase,水瀬 秋子,,"Akiko is Nayuki Minase's mother and Yuichi Aizawa's aunt whose main role is in Nayuki's arc. She has blue hair that is a little lighter and more purple-tinged than Nayuki's hair. She is a little bit taller than her daughter, and instead of letting her hair fall down like Nayuki's, she keeps it in a long braid, which she usually places on her right shoulder. Like Nayuki's, her hair parts at the top of her head and falls down the sides. Akiko has a light complexion and has light blue eyes. She is usually seen smiling. Akiko most often wears a light pink jacket over a white, long-sleeved shirt. 

Akiko is a kind and caring person. She is a great cook, and is proud of her special and unique jam, which no one likes. It's unknown if she has tasted it or if she likes it. She tends to answer yes and no very quickly, usually in one second. For example, when Makoto wanted to keep Piro, she said yes right after the question. Since, she is a mother, she can cook, clean, and will always be there if someone needs her. 

She works at an unspecified job and takes care of the house, cooking various types of food, most of which is good except for her infamous ""special"" homemade jam which she alone enjoys the taste of. She appears to not realize exactly what is going on around her, taking in strays such as Makoto Sawatari and assuming lame excuses for her behavior. She may just realize that Makoto is a good person and can be cured of her anger, which is true. Akiko certainly exhibits more knowledge of the situation than Yuichi as far as the origins of Ayu Tsukimiya and Makoto are concerned, hinting that she is familiar with the supernatural goings-on in the town and how they apply to Yuichi. Akiko is very important to Nayuki since she does not have a father. Akiko is known to be very easy-going and is constantly smiling. She will not even resort to stern lectures, such as when Makoto spends money on herself that Akiko gave her to buy food. Akiko can be assertive, though she never has once raised her voice in anger or otherwise. She will often give responses to questions within one second of being asked, the answer almost always marking approval.

Akiko has some indirect involvement with Makoto Sawatari's and Ayu Tsukimiya's arcs. After Yuichi brought Makoto home for the first time, Akiko shows no intentions of throwing her out or handing her over to the police. She decided to house Makoto for the time being until they could find her parents or until she remembered something. With Ayu, Akiko asked her to stay at their house upon discovering that both of Ayu's parents were out of town. Akiko's main involvement is with her daughter Nayuki's arc. From when Nayuki was very young, Akiko raised her daughter alone; no information is given about Nayuki's father or what happened to him after Nayuki's birth. As such, Akiko and Nayuki are very close and never get in fights with each other.

Jigorou often carried a wooden cane with him likely to support his body due to age. He is commonly seen in the manga wearing a jinbei styled kimono similar to the one worn by Sakonji Urokodai.

Jigorou had a steadfast devotion to his students and strict training. Despite his status as a strong mentor and experience as a previous pillar, he had a soft spot and unwavering dedication towards raising the next generation of students.

Zenitsu noted that despite how often he whined and ran away, Jigorou never gave up on him once. He had saved Zenitsu from a lifetime of debt and taken him on as a student. Showing unyielding patience, he was happy just to see Zenitsu master the first form. He had a great belief in training skills to perfect through repitition comparing it to forging and purifying the steel of their swords.

Sometime after becoming a Demon, Kyogai was lectured by an unknown individual over the quality of his writings. This person noted that he had become boring, only beating his drum and not leaving his house, and didn't have the skills to teach people. As he left, the individual stepped on one of the Demon's papers, causing an irate Kyogai to kill him.

While still a member of the Twelve Demon Moons, Kyogai slowly lost the ability to eat humans. He was visited by Kibutsuji Muzan, who removed his number due to the Drum Demon having reached his limit. Because of this, Kyogai obsessively began his quest to rejoin the Twelve Demon Moons.

At some point, Kyogai captured Teruko and Shoichi's older brother, Kiyoshi, due to him possessing ""rare blood"", and took him to the Drum House. Before he could eat him, he was attacked by two other Demons who were also after Kiyoshi's rare blood, suffering an injury that dislodged the drum from his back.

Like most demons, she is cruel, unfeeling, and murderous towards humans. Though after much time with him, she developed fear for Rui and the Father Spider Demon who abused her for being weaker than expected, this abuse was severe enough to cause her to fully embrace death instead of having to continue on knowing that both Rui and the Father Demon would continue to abuse her, in her final moments she seemed to have regained some of her feelings and memories as a human and seemed to have been genuinely touched by Tanjiro's kindness that she bid him good luck as she died. It was later revealed that compared to the rest of her ""Family"" she was technically the youngest demon of the ""family"" and was still copping with her previous human feelings and memories causing her to cry and grieve many times when remembering them, due to this she became a target of severe reprimand from Rui,due to her inability to be a proper ""Mother"" to her ""Children"",who were all technically older than her.

Race: Human
Gender: Male
Hair Color: Gold with Red Tips

Kyoujurou is a major supporting character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and a major character in the Mugen Train Arc. He is a Demon Slayer of the Demon Slayer Corps and the former Flame Hashira.

Kyoujurou was a young adult of tall stature and athletic build. He is known have an air of great optimism about him, having an enthusiastic smile plastered on his face nearly all the time. He had long bright yellow hair with red streaks akin to flames along with two shoulder-length bangs and two chin-length bangs on the side of his head, black forked eyebrows, and golden eyes that fade to red with white pupils.

Kyoujurou wore a paler brown version of the regular Demon Slayer uniform, which consisted of a brown gakuran jacket, a white belt around his waist and hakama pants. Over this, he wore a haori with a white-yellow gradient pattern and red flame-like ridges at the end that his father Shinjuro once worn and more than likely his father worn when they were the Flame Hashira respectively. Finally, he wore red Kyahan with yellow flames erupting from the bottom-up, with pale brown tabi socks and a pair of white zōri with red straps.

Kyoujurou was greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira, and often came across as cheerfully eccentric. He was amiable, pure of heart and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline. He was an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young age — the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.

Kyoujurou also loved his family immensely, displaying great respect and worry towards his father, Shinjurou Rengoku, despite him growing slowly more aggressive and apathetic towards Kyoujurou. He is incredibly encouraging and optimistic towards his little brother, Senjurou Rengoku, believing in him and wishing him the best no matter what. This is further accentuated during his death where his final words for his father and his little brother were ""take care of your body"" and ""follow your dreams no matter what"". Kyoujurou also believes that if someone lacks immense skill, their hard work towards their dreams and desire to help people doesn't count for nothing.

Beneath his enthusiastic demeanor, Kyoujurou is very logical and tactically intelligent, acting quickly and precisely in battle, especially when the lives of others are on the line. Kyoujurou also is great in seeing talent in others, even in Nezuko, a Demon which he wanted to kill beforehand after seeing her risk her lives to fight Demons. Though he is extremely optimistic, Kyoujurou does sometimes have a sense of foreboding that those he believes in might die, especially his friends which he care deeply for. Lastly, he, like most Demon Slayers, absolutely detest Demons, usually because of their heinous deeds or because of their clashing morale values.

As usual in several demons, he had claw-like nails and the veins on his forehead are quite prominent, in his case, to the point of replacing his eyebrows. His eyes were red without pupils and with prominent dark eye bags. Because he could be divided into two demons apart from himself, each demon differed from the other in the number of horns and clothing. The three demons wore shinobi clothing.

The main body had a single horn in the upper center of its forehead and wore a full-length long-sleeved shinobi uniform with meshes on its wrists and neck, the mesh of the neck having three small ribbons centered hanging from it. There were divisions inside his uniform coat where he could keep the collection of hairpins of his victims.

The second body had two horns, one on each side of its forehead. His shinobi attire did not have sleeves, instead, it had two small triangular meshes in the armpit area and a large triangular mesh in the chest area.

The third body had three horns, each in the position in which the other two bodies had their own horns and wore a shinobi garment sewn with meshes on both sides of the arms, shoulders, and thorax. Under his coat, he wore a sleeveless bottleneck shirt.

When Tanjiro and Nezuko arrived at the hut, the Demon had just killed three people. When the Demon tried to strangle Tanjiro, Nezuko kicked its head clean off its body.

Even without a head, the Demon could still command its body to attack the siblings. The Demon also grew a pair of hands from his head. As the body was furiously attacking Nezuko, Tanjiro tackled the body and threw it off a cliff. However, this did not result in the Demon's death, although losing its body caused it excruciating pain.

Tanjiro had also pinned the Demon's head to a tree with his axe to stop its movements. As he was too compassionate, he failed to kill the Demon before dawn, accidentally allowing the Demon to perish by the sun's first rays instead.

He finds Maomao's apathy toward him refreshing and amusing. Later, his childish curiosity evolves into a one-sided romantic affection.

Jinshi is a beautiful eunuch who works in the palace. With a celestial-like face, not only are women fascinated by him, but men are as well.

Maomao became a maidservant to the Emperor's harem after being kidnapped and sold. She used to live with her father as a pharmacist in the red light district and is very knowledgeable about medicine and poisons but isn't very interested in other humans.

She is skinny and short, and her plain face is covered with freckles.

AbilitiesMaomao's name is derived from 猫 (māo), the Chinese word for cat. This reinforces the fact that she is often described as a cat or cat-like.

As the Emperor, he sees his consorts as little more than political entities, causing some to see him as cruel. While he can be inconsiderate at times—for example, proclaiming his care for the well being of a consort while in the presence of another consort—he seems to be a good father, often visiting the Jade Palace to play with Lingli and talk with Gyokuyou. Maomao describes his taste for women as ""[liking] his fruit ripe and voluptuous,"" a preference which stems in part from his desire to go against his father, who infamously only slept with children.

Eri is shown to be a perfect role model to the students in Otonokizaka High School. With her as the student council president, she is often portrayed as a cold and strict character due to her responsibilities, and being against the idea of Kousaka Honoka and her friends forming an idol group to get more attention from the public.

Eri is highly respected and well-known among the students, especially among her juniors. Unlike Nozomi, she appears rather stoic and skeptical in the early episodes, but it is shown that Eri is actually very kind and caring towards people that are close to her, like her little sister. On top of that, she is also very mature and level-headed and acts as a strategist in promoting their group.

Rin appears to be a tomboy due to playing sports and not wearing a skirt when she was a child. She mostly teases Koizumi Hanayo and appears to be with her most of the time. Her personality is similar to Kousaka Honoka's because they're both determined and hard-working. She usually ends her sentences with nyan~! (Meow). In addition, she sometimes acts like a cat and does the signature curved mouth look. Despite acting like a cat, Rin is, ironically, allergic to cats. Hanayo and Rin once found a stray cat but could not adopt it due to Rin's allergies.

Rin is great at sports, and is skilled in hurdling, football, and basketball. She enjoys dance very much and is the current practice leader of μ's. Her special skill is her sharp nose, which is almost on par with a dog's.

A common joke in the series is that she's often ignored by the other members of μ's at her attempts at being the best idol among them. Niko often gets annoyed with the former student council president, Ayase Eli, for taking away the spotlight from her with her beauty and maturity.

Niko was the Idol Research Club's president until she graduated. In Episode 10 she is shown to be a very skilled cook despite her saying she has never cooked before. However, she accidentally forgot about her lie when it was dinner time, and ended up cooking for everyone to reveal the truth. Niko is also interested in fashion.

Chisato is the childhood friend of Kanon. Being an athletic spirit, she entered Yuigaoka High primarily for dance, but after a chance encounter with the other Liella! members, Chisato decided that she would focus more on becoming a school idol. Chisato works part-time at a Takoyaki food truck, which can be seen parked at Aoyama's open-air food court.

Although Chisato describes herself as being a kind-spirited person, she has also admitted that others can find her ""scary"" when she is mad, a thought that rarely ever crosses her mind. 

Her favorite sayings are ""The Early Bird Gets the Worm"" and ""Fortune comes in at the merry gate.""",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/458092.jpg,181,anime,41169

Kagami is the older fraternal twin sister of Tsukasa. In school, her grades are excellent and she studies very hard. She was even the class president of her class in her first year. She is in a different class than Konata and Tsukasa, but she frequently comes to their class during lunch time to eat with them. Additionally, Kagami chose the humanities course in her second year so that she could be with Konata, but she was the only one separated into a different classroom; the same occurred in her third year. Kagami, seldom referred to as ""Kagamin,"" is a bit egotistical and is not a good cook.

Kagami's physique is average. She has long light purple hair, wears a ribbon tied into pig-tails, and her sharp eyes are light violet. Kagami is the stereotypical ""tsukkomi"" character, however, she is prone to become shy at times, hence being a tsundere character as well. 

Much like Konata, Kagami likes video games, but plays a different genre than Konata: Kagami likes to play scrolling shooters. She loves to read light novels, but she feels lonely at times because no one around her has the same interest as her.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/40319.jpg,3042,anime,1887

Konata Izumi is, more by default than anything else, the ""leader"" of the main characters. Nicknamed ""Kona-chan"" by her friends, she is an eccentric but friendly and outgoing girl, with a mischeivous but good-natured sense of humor. She can be smart, but she hates studying, thus her grades are a bit uneasy. However, she is an expert in pulling an ""all-nighter."" In contrast to her studying habits, she loves video games, to the extent that she can compete against Kagami Hiiragi on trivia games (by remembering the question orders, not by knowing the actual answers). In addition, she loves anime, which is also due to her father, Soujirou Izumi's influence, along with the games. He buys ero-games for himself, so she is able to play and enjoy them. In fact, when she became eighteen, Konata was overjoyed, since she could now go buy and play ero-games legally. In the anime, Konata constantly refers to or parodies several popular games, anime, and manga (much to the annoyance of Kagami), but her favorite franchise seems to be the Haruhi series, as she has many Haruhi figurines and decorations that makes her room, and even once went to the Suzumiya Haruhi no Gekisou with her friends. She often gives false information to her family, thus making her father believe that Kagami and Tsukasa are shrine maidens. Interestingly enough, her voice actress for the animated version, Aya Hirano and Wendee Lee, is in fact the same person who voiced Haruhi Suzumiya in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime; other voice actors from the same series make guest appearances during the course of Lucky ☆ Star.

Since she spends quite a large sum of money on video games and doujinshi, Konata was lucky enough to get a part-time job at a cosplay cafe. Continuing with her theme of playing video games, Konata plays the role of a male character in an online game and is married in that world. Her significant other in the game is coincidently a male gamer using a female character. She often plays late into the night, hence why she tends to fall asleep in class, which makes her a frequent victim to her homeroom teacher, Nanako Kuroi. One of her talents as mentioned on the show is that she can name all the Pok$#!ns

Her physique is smaller than average when compared to her peers, which she claims hasn't changed, since she was in the sixth grade. She is ambidextrous, in contrast to the mostly left-handed main cast. She has long, blue hair which comes down to her calves with a large ahoge, sleepy eyes and a beauty mark under her left eye, just like her father. Her mother, Kanata Izumi, died when she was an infant, and she has lived alone with her father since. In her third year of high school, however, her cousin, Yutaka Kobayakawa, came to live at her house, giving a total of three people in the Izumi residence.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/39208.jpg,15631,anime,1887

Miyuki is a ""young lady"" from a wealthy family whom is also beautiful, smart, and well-mannered. She was the president for her grade level in her first year when she became great friends with Kagami. Now Miyuki is the same class as Konata and Tsukasa. Miyuki is more relied on by her classmates in helping their studies than Nanako. 

Miyuki's physique is average, but she has excellent proportions; she has large breasts that Konata analogies her to a cow. Her appearance is as follow: has long light pink hair, and her eyes, covered by the glasses she wears, are light bluish-purple. She is a stereotypical ""healing-type"" meganekko. Her vision is less than 0.1, though used to be good until elementary school when she started reading books in the dark after her mother dozed off in the midst of reading them to her in her bed. She likes to read books, but does not read light novels. 

Miyuki loves to sleep, and she always goes to sleep at eleven. She used to go to sleep much earlier at ten before her second year. However, she hates going to the dentist, but she frequently has to go there to fix a loose crown or because of tooth decays. On the rare occasion that she plays video games, her personality seems to change.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/80556.jpg,584,anime,1887

He bears a very similar resemblance to Jouji Gouda in Akane Maniax.

Blood type: O

Sōjirō Izumi is Konata Izumi's father, an author who works at home. He always wears loose, traditional Japanese clothing as his work clothes. He loves watching anime and playing video games, which influenced his daughter's interests. Sōjirō is ""also a lolicon"". This appreciation for neoteny may be one factor that caused him to fall in love with Kanata, whom he eventually married. He describes that he likes girls as men normally do, but that he also appreciates younger ones. This means that this attraction is equal or possibly secondary, meaning he does not have a preference for them, so despite being a 'lolicon' (person with a lolita complex) he would not be a pedophile. Throughout the show news reports and conversations indicate that young girls in the area are being approached by a strange man, and a running joke in the show involves hints that Sōjirō is in fact the one doing it. The best example of this is the opening, part of which involves Sōjirō spying on two schoolgirls from behind a lamppost.

Sōjirō is very thin, and has unshaven facial hair, he has a mole under his left eye which his daughter inherited and has thick eyebrows. Additionally, he is allergic to pollen and when he decided to wear goggles and masks as protection from it, Konata sighed that, ""Now you look weirder as well"". She also frequently reminds him, ""Please don't do anything as to be taken away by the cops"". Also, he often forgets to lock the door when he is using the toilet, which has left Yutaka with a tremendous shock.

Sōjirō holds a deep love for his wife, Kanata Izumi, who passed away many years before. When Konata asks why Kanata chose to be with Sōjirō (largely as a joke at his erotic personality's expense), Sōjirō points out that he and his wife simply looked past outwards appearances: Kanata loved Sōjirō despite his otaku tendencies, and Sōjirō obviously did not mind that Kanata had an unusual physique and did not share his hobbies.

43550,Hikage Miyakawa,宮河 ひかげ,,"Age: 9
Birthday: September 6

Hikage is a short, temperamental girl and the youngest in the entire cast of Lucky Star. Hikage's appearance in the game has her with long light-purple hair; her hairstyle is distinctive, as she thinly braids her hair to the right, and uses that as a ribbon to tie her remaining hair. Her eyes are light blue and are slanted upward. Her appearance is a little different in the anime and manga, as she has short, blue hair instead of long, purple hair. 

Hikage or Hikage-chan, is the younger sister of  Hinata Miyakawa . She is the youngest character in the Lucky Star series.

Hikage attends the fourth grade at Sakura-en Public elementary school class 4-1. Hikage exhibits a classic Tsundere personality; and has a considerable dislike for the otaku culture and mannerisms because her sister, being a devout otaku herself, spends the majority of their income on manga, anime, and doujinshi. Because of her sister's mannerisms, Hikage wishes that she could grow up and be able to hold her own job to help support them and afford more expensive items. 

Often played upon is the fact that Hikage is often hungry because of the bare minimum foods the pair is able to afford, and is depicted as having dreams where she is able to eat meat. Hikage's first appearance in the anime is a brief background shot in Episode 12, then she appears alongside her sister in episode 16; after Kagami, Tsukasa, and Miyuki have purchased the comic magazine and Code Geass doujin from Hinata, Hikage comes up to the counter and announces that she is hungry. She is next seen in the 24th episode when they both show up at Ryōō High School to attend the culture festival, only to learn they came a day too early and they can't come in; this is very upsetting to Hikage, who chastises her sister for wasting money on the train ticket when they could have put it towards ""hamburger steak or something fancy."" Hikage also appears alongside her sister in episode 87 (Moe Drill) of the Manga, where she accidentally throws away some of Hinata's manga volumes, discovers her sister watching late-night anime, and learns the value of some of the other volumes that they possess. 

One of her fears is getting in trouble with her sister and being forced to ""...go vegetarian for a week..."", a fear which has been revealed to be an actual method used by Hinata to punish Hikage.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/140333.jpg,21,anime,1887

Yukari Takara is Miyuki Takara's mother, who tends to be very well-mannered, but can be a bit of a klutz. She is warm and friendly, once talking with a telemarketer for over an hour, and has a mischievous sense of humor. Yukari's hair is short and unlike her daughter, she does not wear eyeglasses. She doesn't like to do household chores, which explains why she isn't very skilled with household items. On one occasion, she thought that a colored candle was a popsicle. Yukari is often mistaken for Miyuki's ""big sister"", rather than mother proper, due to her youthfully cuddly appearance, which, combined with her adorably cheerful personality and endearing clumsiness, has resulted in her being regarded as moe, a trait not common for women in anime in their thirties.

Because she usually hides her lack of confidence in her willful attitude, those who don't know her well tend to misunderstand her. Despite her blunt manner, her taste in food is childishly sweet. Her hobby is chasing female idols.

Before her contract with Kyubey, Rena was ostracized by her peers for her standoffish attitude. In reality, this was just a small part of a vicious cycle in which Rena, having faced bullying in the past, guards herself from potential harm and ends up acting vitriolic towards potential friends. With such a nasty reputation, Rena found herself spending her days alone in school and watching charismatic and lovable idols at home. 

When Rena made her wish, she did it in hopes of becoming a better person. In reality, this manifested as a power to change her appearance - useful for disguises, and hiding from her classmates, but not the internal alterations that she wanted. Rena came to hate herself even more. 

It wasn't long into her magical girl duties before Rena met Momoko Togame, an elder magical girl, at an idol show. Through battling the same Witch at said concert, the two garnered a mutual friendship. Because of her laid back and understanding nature, the sisterly Momoko was just the friend Rena needed to make the days a little easier. 

When she introduced Rena to Kaede, a meek and equally lonely magical girl, Rena got possessive of Momoko, fearing her desirability beside the gentle and likable Kaede Akino. Despite her efforts to drive the girl back, a part of Rena hated her behavior, and decided to isolate herself from Momoko and Kaede. 

Kaede, it turns out, is far more understanding of Rena than initially thought, as is Momoko. They see through her actions, ignoring the nastiness put forward and instead recognizing the behavior underlying them. Rena realized she had found loyal friends who truly empathize with her. 

Since then Rena has tried to be better. It's difficult for her to kick habits and kneejerk reactions that have until now protected her from potential bullying. She also fights with Kaede a lot, normally over misunderstandings and slips of the tongue. The two never stay apart for long, however, and after an incident very nearly took Kaede away forever, the two have since gained a deeper understanding of their affections for one another. 

Rena is now a steadfast friend and ally of those affiliated with Momoko's team.

38194,Mami Tomoe,巴 マミ,,"Birthday: June 5

Mami is a veteran magical girl and a third-year student at Madoka's school. She lives alone in a penthouse after the death of her parents in a car accident, one which she was able to survive only due to contracting with Kyubey to save her own life.

Mami is particularly focused on saving those around her, with a traditionally selfless perspective on the role of magical girl, and has a habit of giving names to her finishing attacks. Though her outward disposition is cheery and confident, Mami feels deeply alone as she has no friends to confide in or support her as she fights. Due to her desire to save as many people as she can, Mami tends to clash with other Puella Magi who would rather wait for witches to ""mature"" in order to obtain Grief Seeds, despite that resulting in human casualties.

141954,Tama Inubouzaki,犬吠埼 珠 / たま,,"As a human, Tama Inubouzaki is a fairly average, albeit shy, middleschooler and the eldest of three siblings. Tama is often left downtrodden by her mother and siblings due to her unremarkable athletic abilities and below-average intelligence, especially compared to her siblings. Her tendency to never raise her hand in class and to fall away during physical exercise makes her the least-popular student in her grade. Despite this, her grandmother appreciates her for being kind regardless of her other shortcomings.

As a magical girl, Tama (spelled with different characters compared to her real name) is a part of Team Ruler, alongside Ruler, Swim Swim, and the Peaky Angels Minael and Yunael. She has dog ears and a tail, and her costume consists of a hooded capelet, oversized paw gloves and black and white polka-dot tights resembling a dalmatian's coat, plus a pet collar and leash given to her by Ruler.
Much like in her homelife, Tama is often undermined by Ruler for her ability - to create holes in any surface she scratches - which doesn't have many practical uses, and for being overly-affectionate towards her boss. Still, Tama enjoys her teammates' company, and was even overjoyed when Ruler disrespectfully gave her the leash - a gesture which Tama perceived to be an act of kindness.

Tama is often seen with a vacant expression leading Swim Swim to feel sorry for her and give her affectionate pats on the head, although in reality Tama is just spacing-out as she processes everything going on around her. Tama and Swim Swim are very close, with the former giving the latter the nickname Swim-chan (localized to just ""Swim"" in Yen Press's English translation of the novels, and as ""Swimmy"" in the anime's English dub).

Tama is extremely cowardly, fleeing when she witnesses Snow White and La Pucelle practicing poses in the magical chat room during the events of Magical Girl Tropes and again upon first seeing Hardgore Alice during Magical Girl Raising Project.







In It Happens From Time to Tama, it is revealed that she achieved the highest level and maxed-out her stats in the Magical Girl Raising Project mobile game. This fact, along with her ability aiding in studying soil and finding ammonite fossils, earns Tama Inubouzaki the respect of one of her classmates who was reluctantly paired up with her for a school assignment.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/318832.jpg,50,anime,33003

1742,Conan Edogawa,江戸川 コナン,Shinichi Kudou|Shin-chan|Cool Kid|Silver Bullet|Jimmy Kudo,"Age: 6-7 (as Conan); 17 (as Shinichi)
Height: Unknown (as Conan); 174 cm (as Shinichi)
Weight: 18 kg (as Conan)
Date of Birth: May 4
Relatives: Yuusaku Kudou (father) &amp; Yukiko Kudou (mother)
Nicknames: Cool Kid (Jodie Starling), Cool Guy (Vermouth), Silver Bullet-kun (Vermouth), Glasses Kid (Sonoko Suzuki), Holmes' Apprentice (Apollo &amp; Minerva Glass)

At the beginning of the series, Shinichi Kudou is a 17-year-old student at Teitan High School. He is already well-known as a brilliant young detective, the ""Savior of the police force,"" for solving many difficult cases that the professionals could not. However, while investigating two mysterious men, he is spotted and forced to swallow an experimental poison known as APTX 4869. This results in his body shrinking to that of a 6-year-old.

Shinichi comes up with the alias Conan Edogawa after Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa and pretends to be a distant relative of Agasa's who places Conan in Ran's care. Ran's father Mouri Kogorou, owns a Detective Agency which Conan uses to his advantage to discover cases involving the Black Organization.

As Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating Kogorou's voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. By solving cases one after the other, he helps build up Kogorou's reputation who will later on be referred to as ""Sleeping Kogorou."" He also spends a good amount of time with his Detective Boys fellows and solves many small cases with them and sometimes in the company of Professor Agasa.

Conan remains very close to Ran, who in return is very protective of him. However, because Ran is unaware of his true identity, Conan often finds himself in awkward situations with her, such as when she confessed her feeling for Shinichi to him and when she made him bathe with her at a hot spring.

Conan's intelligence remains intact even though he has shrunken into a child. As Shinichi, his deductive ability earned him the monikers ""Heisei Holmes"" and ""Savior of the Japanese police force."" Conan maintains an extraordinarily broad knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases and escape tricky situations. Conan tries to speak in a child-like manner when dealing with adults, but he often gets caught up in the current case and begins speaking like an adult, referring to advanced topics and using reasoning much too complex for a normal child. When this happens, he often tries to pass it off as ""something [he] heard on TV"" or ""taught by uncle Kogoro/professor Agasa/Shinichi-niichan.""


Likewise, he makes no effort to hide his love for Sherlock Holmes and soccer, so if he called out for talking about either subject in too much detail, he tries to escape suspicion by saying it was something Shinichi told him about. Although as the series has progressed the adults around him have become more used to his ""being quite smart for a child,"" causing him to behave more like himself around them, he still tries to pass as a normal child. The only police officers with whom Conan can speak in a professional manner are the FBI, especially Jodie Starling, Shuichi Akai, James Black, and Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Police, all of whom suspect that there is more to Conan than meets the eye.

Conan tends to act more like himself around the Detective Boys, even to the point that they find it odd when he acts like a child around adults. He will often play games like baseball with the Detective Boys, but he is too used to soccer to perform well and will even instinctively use soccer techniques, such as kicking in games that do not call for it. Because he is unfamiliar with popular games and TV shows, and bad at video games, Genta and the others tend to think of him as dumb. This annoys Conan so much that he will secretly watch TV in the living room after Kogoro and Ran go to sleep to get more ""practice"" in.

4162,Hiroshi Agasa,阿笠 博士,Herschel Agasa,"Agasa Hiroshi is an inventor and Shinichi's closest neighbor, living in a large house right next to the Kudou residence. He makes his living with a wide number of patents and inventions, mostly video games (of whom the Detective Boys are enthusiastic test players). He has been a friend of Shinichi and Ran since their childhood years. 

After Shinichi had been shrunk by the APTX 4869, the first person he met and entrusted himself to was Agasa. After having been convinced that the little boy was Shinichi, Agasa was also the first one to advise Shinichi to exercise caution in his pursuit of the Black Organization. He also helped Shinichi in establishing his new identity as Edogawa Conan, including constructing several gadgets which help Shinichi in carrying on his detective work surreptitiously, and in order to perfect Conan's cover, he also enlisted him into Teitan Elementary and thus came to know the children who would form the Detective Boys. When Miyano Shiho fled the clutches of the Black Organization, she fled to Shinichi's house but collapsed from exhaustion before Agasa's doorstep. Agasa subsequently took her in, learned about her true identity and helped her establish her new identity as Haibara Ai. He also entrusted Shinichi's parents with the secret about what has happened to their son.

Ever since these beginnings, Agasa has been an invaluable friend for Shinichi and the Detective Boys as a confidant, paternal friend, and someone to hang out with. He often takes the children on trips, most of which turn into criminal cases instead. 

Agasa is a jovial and outgoing person and has many friends in his community, a fact which helped him in his covering up of Conan's and Haibara's true origins (he simply claims that they are the children of his friends and acquaintances).

12051,Shuuichi Akai,赤井 秀一,Shuu|Rye|Moroboshi Dai|Silver Bullet,"Akai Shuuichi is an American of Japanese descent and member of the American Federal Bureau of Investigation, on special assignment in Japan to capture Vermouth. His superior is James Black and his partner is Jodie Starling. He had infiltrated the Black Organization under the name Moroboshi Dai—and the codename ""Rye""—as a mole and dated Miyano Akemi, one of their low-ranking members, to feed information to the FBI. In order to facilitate the latter, and later because he had genuinely developed feelings for Akemi, Akai saw himself forced to break up his then on-going relationship with Jodie. Later on, his cover in the Black Organization was accidentally blown by his colleague Andre Camel, and when Akemi was killed, he declared her murderer, Gin (with whom he seems to have had some tensions even before his exposure), his personal enemy.

Akai is a very professional agent. Even in personal matters, he remains cool, even detached, from anyone, but his redeeming value is a great sense of loyalty to anyone he knows. He is a skilled and relentless pursuer and detective, qualities which have labeled him the number one enemy of the Black Organization and earned him the nickname ""Silver Bullet."" He looks forward to opportunities to hunt the Black Organization down and get revenge for Akemi.

Amuro has a cheerful personality. He is also generous, bringing a plate of sandwiches for the detective agency bought with his money.

Although somewhat of a ""cool type,"" he does not hide his emotions and is quite expressive. Like other detectives in Detective Conan, he enjoys presenting his deductions about cases to others.

4251,Genta Kojima,小嶋 元太,George Kaminski,"Kojima Genta is a student in Teitan Elementary when Shinichi joins his class as Edogawa Conan. Shortly afterwards, he and his classmate Ayumi decide to investigate an apparently haunted mansion, and they persuade Conan to come along. When their friend and classmate Mitsuhiko expresses his skepticism about supernatural hauntings, Genta forcefully 'persuades' him to tag along as well. As it turns out, the haunting is a cover-up for an old homicide case.

Soon after, the accidental acquisition of a treasure map leads Ayumi, Genta, Mistuhiko and Conan on a hunt for a cache of stolen Italian gold coins, during which Conan saves them from getting killed by the mafia members who are also after the gold. After the case is resolved, Mitsuhiko joins Genta and Ayumi in forming the nucleus of an amateur detective group, the Detective Boys. Genta is quick to pronounce himself the leader of the group, but his lackadaisical leadership abilities are commonly neglected in the field, and in fact everyone (even Genta) unconsciously views Conan as the group's actual leader. Genta's school shoe locker is used as a mailbox for any of their fellow students to present them with a case to solve. 

Genta loves food, especially unagi, and can eat more than all the other Detective Boys members combined. When discussions of money come up, Genta tends to think about it in terms of how many unagi bowls he could buy. He also tends to mess up certain Japanese terms with similar-sounding words (especially if the latter are related to food) and sometimes has trouble reading even the most common Kanji, which on occasion causes some ridicule from his classmates and friends. His brash personality, lack of awareness of his surroundings, and tendency to not think before acting often lands the Detective Boys (or at least himself) in sticky situations.

Even though he is brash, outspoken and can be intimidating, Genta is actually very kind and dependable. He is a good friend of Ayumi and Mitsuhiko, and has been shown to greatly admire his father, who is considered to be a classic ""Child of Edo"".

4253,Juuzou Megure,目暮 十三,Inspector|Joseph Meguire,"Megure Juuzou, commonly referred to as Inspector Megure, is a Police Inspector (Rank 6) in Division 1 of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. He is almost always there on the scene when a murder occurs, always interviewing the suspects, and acting as the commanding officer of the group of police he brings along with him, among them Takagi Wataru, Satou Miwako, Shiratori Ninzaburou and Chiba.

Megure is a capable veteran officer who cares much for his underlings, but he is prone to occasional shouting fits whenever something does not go right or when his temper gets the better of him. He also has little patience for fools, but tends to be a bit too conservative, limiting his ability for flexible thinking.

Shortly after Megure had come to the police force, he was involved in a case in which he would meet his future wife, Midori. As a result of the case, he has taken to wearing a hat in public in order to hide a scar which he gained and his own self-consciousness about how he came to his marriage. Megure was also a good friend of star detective story novelist Kudou Yuusaku, and would in the past consult him about one case or another. On many such occasions, Yuusaku would take his son Shinichi with him, who would pick up his father's investigative skills and eventually become a detective in his own right.

After Shinichi solved their first mutual case for him, he has regularly consulted him in difficult cases and considered him a great help. In stark contrast to this, he tends not to think much of Conan and the Detective Boys, usually thinking of them as a nuisance until they solve the ongoing case for him. Likewise, from their common police days, he has no high regard for Kogorou, and he thinks that he may actually be under some kind of jinx, since wherever Kogoro shows up, there is always some murder case nearby (a fact which actually conforms to Conan, which in later cases he seems to have realized).

In some anime originals, Megure has the habit of trying to tell the culprit about the morals of doing wrong, which he rarely does in the manga series.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/71297.jpg,19,anime,53540
1748,Ran Mouri,毛利 蘭,Angel|Rachel Moore,"Mouri Ran is a childhood friend of Kudou Shinichi. She is the daughter of Mouri Kogorou, a private detective, and Kisaki Eri, a lawyer. Her parents got separated when she was seven, and one of her biggest goals is to get them back together. Her best friend next to Shinichi is her classmate Suzuki Sonoko, who constantly teases her about her relationship with Shinichi.

After Shinichi's disappearance, Ran met Edogawa Conan, who was introduced by Professor Agasa as a ""distant relative"" and asked Ran if she wouldn't mind taking care of him at her house. She and her father practically adopted him; Ran immediately came to think of him as a surrogate little brother. Little did (and still does) Ran know that ""Conan"" is actually Shinichi.

Ran's greatest personality trait is that she genuinely cares for those she loves. She is also patient, kind, and nurturing. Like Shinichi, she highly values justice to the point of idealism. To avoid making Shinichi choose between her and his important case (really an excuse because Shinichi has turned into Conan and can't return), she has decided to wait for him to finish it, trusting his promise that he will come back despite their separation causing Ran a lot of emotional pain. Ran is also very hot-blooded and tends to act on impulses when the people she cares about are involved; the combination of jumping to conclusions and not hesitating to use karate on those who she perceives to have wronged someone have led to several ""near-miss"" misunderstandings. Early on, she would become violently suspicious if she thought Shinichi was philandering although more recently his confessions have lead her to trust his intentions. Even though Ran is in love with Shinichi, she often fails to convey her feelings because she suddenly becomes self conscious.

She can be very brave and resourceful when she wants to be, and rescues Conan from trouble on occasion. However, she has an irrational fear of the supernatural and is thus—unlike her friend Sonoko—absolutely no fan of anything related to the horror genre. She also constantly tries to reunite her father and mother again - though with little success, thanks to the mutual stubbornness of both parents. Men also tend to pay her a lot of undue romantic attention, a fact that makes Sonoko somewhat jealous (and of which Ran herself is completely unaware).

Ran is very self sufficient for her age. This is because her father is drunk, slovenly, and fiscally irresponsible. She handles many of the Mouri household's financial affairs and all the cooking and housework. She also ensures Kogorou doesn't slack off on his job, is on his best behavior for client meetings, and she often greets and provides refreshments for potential clients.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/308335.jpg,962,anime,53540
1746,Kogorou Mouri,毛利 小五郎,Richard Moore|Sleeping Kogorou|Nemuri no Kogorou,"Mouri Kogorou is a private detective and Ran's father. Some time ago, he worked in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Division One with Inspector Megure, but while an excellent marksman he was not a particularly good investigator. Around the time Mouri left the police force, his wife Kisaki Eri also moved out, though they have never officially divorced despite ten years having passed.

Mouri has an overinflated sense of his own importance and detective prowess to the point where he doesn't investigate why he is suddenly and consistently passing out at crime scenes and solving cases in his sleep with different deductions than he was making while awake. He is also frequently unprofessional in his work, frequently making sarcastic and blunt comments about suspects or even his own clients. 

On cases, Mouri is typically lax with his deductions and investigation, following only the most obvious clues or assumptions to reach his conclusions, which are often silly or fall directly into a culprit's trap. The police, especially Megure, often find him to be an embarrassment while awake and hope to see ""Nemuri no Kogorou""  (Sleeping Detective) as soon as possible. Mouri does have a serious side which only emerges when the case has personal importance to him, such as when Eri and Ran are involved. When this happens, Mouri's entire personality and demeanor changes and he begins acting professionally, demonstrating improved deductive skills and cunning. While he is not up to the standards of Shinichi and he still can have problems with finding clues, his logical reasoning becomes better, and Mouri often demonstrates he has a better sense of interpersonal relationships than Shinichi does.

Mouri easily becomes infatuated with beautiful women. His favorite celebrity is pop idol Okino Yoko, and he never misses (or tries not to miss) her television shows. He also keeps a large collection of Yoko related goods and his office and bedroom have Yoko posters. Because of his flirtatious behavior around attractive women, he often embarrasses Ran, and while it is not stated as the reason why Eri left him, it is one of the primary reasons why she hasn't come back.

While never outright called an alcoholic, Mouri has a tendency to get intoxicated and Shinichi/Conan often makes sarcastic remarks about him spending money on alcohol. In the anime, particularly in early episodes, his office is littered with empty beer cans, and he keeps a well-stocked liquor shelf. Mouri is also a heavy smoker, and is usually seen with a cigarette in his mouth. Other hobbies include watching his favorite idol star, Okino Yoko, betting on horse races, playing mahjong (which he tends to lose) and playing or watching baseball (he even plays in his neighborhood's team). 

In the movies, Mouri suffers from a mild acrophobia (fear of heights) and is quite uncomfortable in high settings where he has the chance to see how high up he is. He does not have this fear in the manga.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/146129.jpg,588,anime,53540

9180,Ninzaburou Shiratori,白鳥 任三郎,Nicholas Santos,"Shiratori's debut was in the first movie, The Clockwork Skyscraper, acting as a member of Megure's police force. At first, Shiratori only appeared in movie roles, playing key roles in the first three Detective Conan movies. At some point, Shiratori later became a full-fledged inspector.

As a child, Shiratori studied diligently to one day become a lawyer, and had even memorized some laws by heart. One day, he witnessed a young girl confronting two juveniles trying to steal mangas from a bookstore. To thank him for helping her out, the girl bought him a drink and made a sakura petal pattern from the straw wrapper, saying the sakura was the symbol of courage for the Japanese police (due to the distinct form of the Japanese police badge). It was because of this incident that Shiratori decided to become a cop rather than a lawyer.

Shiratori later joined the Tokyo Metropolian Police Department and worked alongside Inspector Megure, often acting as an extra officer or pair of eyes, though he later became an inspector of his own. When Satou Miwako joined the department, Shiratori believed that he had found his childhood love again, and as a result both he and his younger colleague Takagi considered each other rivals for Satou's affections. Shiratori would often try to show off in front of Takagi by asking Satou on a date, but she always rejected him, much to his dismay. However, he has since come to date Kobayashi Sumiko, whom he finally discovered to be his true love. 

As a cop, Shiratori is fairly average. He is calmer on the case than Takagi or Satou. Shiratori, like Satou and Takagi, believes that Conan has a lot of intelligence for a boy his age, but unlike Takagi and Satou, he usually tends to care not much for Conan's opinion. He often feels that Conan gets in the way, though Conan always proves otherwise. However, unlike Kogorou, Shiratori will take notice and suspect something if Conan points something quite interesting. Shiratori's attitude can appear cocky when battling for Satou's affections, but otherwise he appears more modest, as in the first Detective Conan movies or when he is with is now girlfriend Kobayashi Sensei.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/138257.jpg,10,anime,53540

Sonoko and Mouri Ran have been best friends ever since they were little. Sonoko is often there to help Ran whenever she is bullied by other school children, more often there than even Shinichi was. Although Ran knows that Sonoko has a lot of money, she always makes sure that money never gets involved in thier friendship, not going to ski vacations with Sonoko because she doesn't have the money, when she knows that Sonoko would pay for her to go. This, along with other things, has helped strengthen the bond between both Ran and Sonoko. 

Before she began dating Kyougoku Makoto, Sonoko displayed the typical girl her age, acting very boy-crazy, and often mostly thinking about trying to snag the ""perfect boy."" She would often act sad because she couldn't get a boyfriend, using all necessary means to try and get one. She often dressed in clothes meant to attract boys, and would try to sweet talk her way into being with a boy, by making him chocolates, trying to impress a boy while wearing a bikini, or going to various events that young guys were going to attend. Ran, in the meanwhile, would always be the one to unwillingly attract the boys, which would cause jealousy in Sonoko. However, this all changed when Sonoko met and began dating Makoto.... well, not quite. She still flirts with boy sometimes, but in the end it's still Makoto that she likes.

Vermouth is confident in her abilities, is very bold, and an expert at manipulating situations to her advantage: traits which allow her to single-handedly weave complex plots and take the upper hand even while she is being monitored by enemies. She is intelligent and insightful, but her personality is contradictory at times. On one hand, she is a cruel and ruthless agent who will blackmail an unwilling man to commit murder by threatening him and his family just to provide a distraction and happily tell an FBI agent she should smile because she will see her dead father again in heaven. On the other hand, she risks her life several times to protect Conan, Ran, and Kogoro, and her friendly behavior while in disguise as Tomoaki Araide left the real Araide wondering if Vermouth is really a bad person.

They persuaded Conan to come along, and Genta also personally drafted Mitsuhiko when the latter expressed his criticism about supernatural hauntings.

As it turned out, the haunting served as a cover-up for an old homicide case. Following its resolution, the foursome decided to stay together and form the nucleus of what would become the Detective Boys. For a time, Ayumi was the sole female member of the Detective Boys until Haibara joined the group. During a case involving a cache of stolen Italian gold coins just prior to the official formation of the Detective Boys, Conan saved the group from getting killed by the Mafioso who were also after the gold, earning Ayumi's gratitude which quickly developed into a serious crush.

Ayumi is a naive and innocent little girl who shows courage from time to time and acts as the team's cheerful spirit.

- The name Hotaru is written in hiragana (ほたる), which has no special meaning. However, when written in kanji (蛍), it could possibly mean ""firefly"". Hotaru's surname Hoshikawa means ""star"" (星) (hoshi) and ""river, stream"" (川) (kawa)

She is dressed in a khaki shirt worn over a black collared top, the latter of which is also decorated with the same bird design as in her hair clip, and wears a pair of dark red pants held in place by suspenders. Her footwear of choice is a pair of black high-heeled sandals.

She is a professional onmyouji and belongs to the same university that Deishuu Kaiki and Meme Oshino studied in and the three are known to be constantly together as members of the university's occult research club. Among the three, she is the one who prefers to stand for justice. Between those three university students, she was the only one who graduated. Yozuru is a rather famous figure in the realm of the supernatural, to the point that Shinobu Oshino, herself a very powerful oddity, refused to divulge any information about her as a form of respect. She speaks in a Kyoto dialect, and is described as having the expertise in the dialect as a native speaker. She also has an unusual quirk of avoiding to step on the ground, as if playing a game where the ground is a sea filled with sharks. She maintains this quirk at all times, and would even use her familiar Yotsugi Ononoki as a platform of sorts if needed.


She fights by using her fists and is powerful enough to punch through multiple floors at once. Unlike Meme, Deishu, and Gaen, she works for free which means that she only hunts and kills oddities because that is what she truly wanted. Yozuru calls herself ""Japan's first battle onmyouji."" She is sadistic and brutal and chose to specialize in exorcising immortal beings because nothing else is a challenge for her. Although she considers herself as an ally of justice, her ideology is based on exacting justice by eliminating those who should not exist (immortal oddities) and disregarding the consequences and doing such an act. To her, immortal oddities have no place in the world. Despite this, however, she has a considerate side as well, seeing people like Koyomi as a human despite having contact with an oddity. According to Koyomi himself, Yozuru reminds him of Meme somewhat. Yozuru uses her judgement on which immortal kais to fight and hunt by separating them into what is alive forever and what is dead forever. She then hunts kai that are considered alive forever and that's why Yotsugi is her assistant as Yotsugi is technically not alive.

While Koyomi was fighting her, he counted how many times she punched him while breaking through the floors,—he counted almost 500.

Kaiki has a gloomy personality and subscribes to the view that there is nothing in the world that is inherently true.

Occupation: Superhero
Level: 
Affiliation: Hero Association
Partner(s): Genos

Saitama is the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds.

He is registered with the Heroes Association as a C-Class Superhero and is tasked to defend Z-City against Mysterious Beings.

Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a simpler style than other characters, with a very rounded head and only a simple mouth and eyes. When drawn in a more 'action-oriented' style with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features, dangerous looking eyes, and chiseled musculature. His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt. The costume is finished out by an ensemble of red boots and gloves, and a white cape.

For a superhero, Saitama is rather laid back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.

Armored Gorilla is an artificial mutant created by Dr. Genus of the House of Evolution. Unlike his peers, Armored Gorilla's body is mostly robotic, making him the third-strongest specimen in the House of Evolution, and its only battle cyborg. 

Appearance: Armored Gorilla is a massive cyborg with a gorilla head. His body is protected by full plate armor adorned with spikes on its shoulders, knee pads, and gauntlets. The armor's belt buckle resembles a gorilla's face, and the chest plate features a custom patch featuring the letters 'A' and 'G' arranged in a diamond shape.

While Armored Gorilla's head appears biological, it also houses cybernetic components.

Personality: Initially, Armored Gorilla behaves like an automaton, communicating with technical readouts in a robotic, monotone voice. After he and his colleagues (Beast King, in particular) are defeated, however, he drops this facade and speaks normally, admitting he was simply trying to act cool.

Under duress, Armored Gorilla is spineless, apologizing profusely and bargaining for his life by revealing information about his creator, Dr. Genus, and the House of Evolution.

Atomic Samurai has long black hair tied back in a topknot. He has sunken cheeks, a defined jawline and a small goatee. His attire consists of a hooded cloak with an atom symbol on the back that's draped over his open coat. Beneath the coat is a typical samurai gi and the footwear is a pair of waraji sandals. He sports a pair of katanas on his left hip, and based on the length, it is likely that he wields either a daito, a ōdachi, or both. The tsuka is typical for a katana, but the unique design would be the atomic shape of the guard.

Atomic Samurai has a rather prideful personality, seen when he refused to shake Saitama's hand telling him that he only acknowledges the strong and saying that he would greet him if he makes it to the higher ranks of S-Class. He also appears to dislike being called old.

When the armour is broken by Saitama's punch, he attains a more intimidating and slightly more muscular build, while his skin darkens in colour, parts of his body grow scales and spikes, and his markings start emitting energy, and gain a lighter colour. In his Meteoric Burst form, his appearance changes drastically. His hair grow reaching his back, his eye's sclera becomes black, and his body becomes engulfed in energy, while his markings now return to their original, dark colour.

Personality: Thanks to his amazing powers, Boros is both arrogant and prideful. Due to his love of battles and inability to find any opponent who has been able to match him in power, he roams the universe looking for worthy opponents that would be stand against him. He met a prophet that revealed to him that in a far off planet he would finally find a strong opponent that would be able to fight on par with him, giving Boros the enjoyable fight he had always desired.

Puri-Puri Prisoner is a flamboyant, openly homosexual superhero. He takes an interest in other good looking male heroes and criminals; an interest which led to his titular jail sentence, as he kept attacking them. Criminals that he apprehends are then added to his harem. He appears to be rather absent-minded, as he did not think to remove his sweater before bulking up, and then blamed his opponent, the Deep Sea King, for its destruction.

The word Puri-puri describes the feeling of snapping into a fresh shrimp or a plump hot dog. Bursting with juiciness and bounce, puri-puri evokes the springiness and slight resistance of collagen—which is why it's also sometimes used to describe a young girl's cheeks.

Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a land in the north known as Yoitsu. She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.

She refers to herself as the ""Wise Wolf of Yoitsu"" (ヨイツの賢狼). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that fact, but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. She is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it.

Marlheit is a middle-aged man with bespectacled blue-gray eyes and straight, medium-length blonde hair in a modified pageboy cut.

Though he shares the occasional lengthy joke, Marlheit is generally calm and rational, especially when confronting a crisis. His success as branch manager is partly due to these traits. The main reasons, however, are his ability to read people and his willingness to take risks when appropriate, as exemplified when he decides to help Lawrence despite knowing Holo’s true nature. Though his primary concern is with the success of his company, he is not an apathetic man, as he more than empathized with Lawrence's concern over Holo's capture, and therefore satisfied both halves of his nature by concocting a plan in which he could both assist Lawrence and Holo while still covering his business interests.

Birthday: April 8
Height: 165 cm
Weight: 45 kg
Sizes: 82-54-81

Kirino is Kyosuke's 14-year-old younger sister. She is mature for her age with a cold, tsundere-like personality. She has a strong ""little sister"" fetish and owns many adult games with older brother/little sister themes, relying on a modeling job to pay for them. Despite this, she states she does not know why she started liking it, though it is suggested that she has a brother complex and is using the games as a surrogate to this. She often denies such feelings and believes the 2D and 3D worlds should be kept separate.

As a student, Kirino possesses a keen focus to studying and athletics. This attitude of hers when it comes to school activities has rewarded her with above-average marks, even as she enters the career of modeling. She developed a sort of perfectionist attitude due to becoming an overachiever, which eventually made her more prone to struggling when the odds are against her. When these moments come, however, she displays a more passive side.

Upon her initial interactions with Kyousuke, she demonstrates an attitude similar to a ""tsundere,"" with the bossy and abusive part more dominant. Although she maintains this attitude, she slowly tries to open up to her brother at times, reluctantly expressing gratitude on things that Kyousuke has done for her.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/101419.jpg,3658,anime,8769

Kyousuke is the seventeen-year-old main character. He describes himself as average: he has average grades, lives in an average family (upper-middle class with a father, mother and sister), and has average physical features. Currently, he attends an average high school with Manami (later, Kuroneko as well); he begins the story as a first-year, but he becomes a second-year during the events of the novel. As far as future plans, he intends to attend the same local university as his childhood friend, Manami.

At the beginning of the series, Kyousuke and his younger sister, Kirino, have a distant relationship. Kyousuke says that they entered a ""cold war"" of sorts a few years ago, but the details of this cold war have yet to be revealed. After years of coldness between the two, things suddenly change when Kyousuke finds one of Kirino's adult games and learns that she is an otaku. Through this, he tries to be a supportive older brother while realizing that he knows very little about his sister (for example, Kyousuke was oblivious to the fact that she was a model, a track star, and one of the top five students of the prefecture). Kyousuke feels somewhat belittled by Kirino's accomplishments, but he learns to take pride in her.

After discovering Kirino's secret hobbies, Kyousuke provides Kirino with ""life counseling"" at her request. During this ""life counseling,"" Kirino forces Kyousuke to play eroge. Kyousuke now considers himself to be a bit of an otaku and often refers to situations and people using otaku terms (e.g., flag events, tsundere, yandere). Trying to be a good brother, Kyousuke offers to accompany Kirino to her offline meet-up. This introduced him to Saori and Kuroneko; both of them have become his friends. Additionally, Kyousuke is friends with Manami, one of his childhood friends. Some of Kyousuke's classmates assume that Kyousuke and Manami are going out, but Kyousuke denies this. When Akagi asked Kyousuke if he would be okay if someone started dating Manami, Kyousuke said that he would be uncomfortable with the situation.

Kyousuke is a good-hearted character and is extremely loyal to his friends and Kirino. He's willing to take risks for them and help them at any cost. When Kuroneko started attending the same high school as Kyousuke, she was without any friends; however, Kyousuke joined the computer research club with her, despite being ignorant about anything concerning computers, in order for her to meet new friends. He has shown the same amount of concern for other friends as well as his sister on several occasions.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/101411.jpg,506,anime,8769

Ayase is Kirino's friend and classmate who works as a model alongside her and is also her best friend. Ayase is a friendly, nice, and refined lady, but becomes agitated and somewhat violent at the thought that she is being lied to, which she hates above all else. She tends to believe what she sees on the news. Therefore, she disapproves of anime and manga, calling it a disgusting hobby, especially eroge, due to the media portrayal that otaku will eventually become criminals. Originally she had a simple crush on Kyosuke, thinking of him as Kirino's caring brother. That all changed when she finds out of Kirino's otaku hobby and how he was aware of it and helps support it. She later refers to Kyosuke when she needs to talk about Kirino and her hobby, even asking for his help in making up with Kirino.

Ruri Gokou—perhaps better known as her alter-ego Kuroneko (“Black Cat”)—is a member of the All Together, Otaku Girls online community that Saori manages. She goes to an offline meet-up where she meets both Saori and Kirino in person. Like Kirino, she remains aloof during this meeting, and it isn't until after the meeting at Saori's post-gathering that she is formally introduced. Kuroneko is a fan of teenage fantasy anime and is sickened by cute anime, like Meruru. Naturally, this precipitates several arguments between Kirino and her, but they still manage to maintain a friendship despite their differences. Kuroneko is shown to care greatly for her friends despite her cold attitude towards people of “the mortal world.”

Kuroneko is known for her dark clothing and scarlet eyes. She cosplays daily in gothic lolita clothing similar to those worn on her favorite anime, Maschera ~Lamentation of the Fallen~. However, it is revealed that scarlet isn't her real eye color; she just wears contacts (her real irises are lavender). She writes doujinshi and novels, but none of her works are popular.

Sakura Akino, nicknamed Cosmos (秋桜), is a third year High School student and the Student Council President.

Cosmos is a hardworking and proper girl who is very organized and always on time, if not early, to everything. She always carries her notebook, in which she writes frequently to make notes and plans.

Cosmos's whole demeanor changes when she is nervous, especially around Sun (Cosmos' crush). When she gets nervous, she panics when speaking, which leads to her saying the wrong thing, and she sometimes even talks like a cat-girl unintentionally.
She has something of a coping mechanism to suppress her panic when speaking, in which she talks like an Edo-era samurai.

Aoi Hinata, also known by her nickname Himawari (向日葵), is a main character in OreSuki. She is a second year high school student and is also the ace of the school's Tennis Club.

Himawari is a bubbly and energetic social butterfly. Despite her outgoing nature, she gets nervous easily, especially around her crush at the beginning of the series, Sun. However after a fight broke out between the group and the reconciled as friends she doesn't have feeling for him anymore and does not appear nervous around him anymore. Himawari is fairly hyperkinetic and is shown to be a physically affectionate person mostly to Joro as she greets him by slapping his back or even tackling him, much to his annoyance. When asking for a favor she can be rather clingy, something that has aroused Joro in many occasions. After Sun's plot was revealed, Himawari was extremely apologetic toward Joro and wanted to stay out of his way to avoid causing more trouble. She was overjoyed when Joro reconciled with her. She does try to help joro in many situations but often unintentionally annoys or hurts him. However it seems that she isn't good at reading his emotions which causes confusion between the two. According to Joro, Himawari’s eyes would dart to the right once and the left twice whenever she is lying.

Sumireko Sanshokuin, sometimes called by her nickname Pansy (三色菫), is a main character in Oresuki. She is a second year High School student and a helper in the school library.

Pansy looks like an unattractive gloomy bookworm with long black hair tied in braids, thick glasses and a sharp tongue towards Joro. Beneath her unappealing exterior, she is in fact a gorgeous beauty with a bust size far larger than she typically shows.

Pansy presents herself as an authentic and common person yet an individual with strong charisma and observation. From her perspectives and experiences, she shows herself to be a well-mannered smooth-talker with good advice and a level head, as well as a lovable beauty queen. She appears as a strong person with powerful enthusiasm, but she does show fear at the thought of being with her stalkers.

She is polite to her peers at school, only turning a sharp tongue at Joro. After she makes friends with Himawari, Cosmos and Sun, she shows that she is very kind and considerate to people close to her.

Pansy was pushed into dating Hose in middle school, and she moved away to get away from him, as well as vowed to never keep her true feelings hidden and clash with them head-on once she’s become a high schooler (which trouble Joro the most). She sees that Joro is very similar to Hose and she aims to prevent him from becoming like Hose by giving him affection, as well as forcing him to face his shortcomings such as his inferiority complex.

Hina Hanetachi, also known by her nickname Asunaro (翌桧), is a character in Oresuki. She is a second year student in High School and a member of the school Newspaper Club.

Asunaro is a cheerful and energetic girl who is kind and helpful. As part of the Newspaper Club, she is often running around gathering information for her articles.

Asuanaro loves Joro that she has tried to get closer to him, but rarely finds the opportunity to because he is often with Himawari or Cosmos, which drives her to become jealous of them. After the climax of the First Arc, Joro no longer spent time with Himawari and Cosmos, but before Asunaro could make a move, she saw Joro with Pansy. This causes her to see Pansy as her main rival. She decides it is impossible for her to grow to be the closest to Joro, so she formulates a plan to push the others away from him.

Asunaro is very manipulative and good with words. She effortlessly blackmailed Joro by threatening to release a false article about him. She was also able to send an anonymous message to several people, worded in such a way that discouraged them all from participating in the Kabuten dance, and even poisoned Sun, all so that she would be able to dance with Joro.

Sasanqua is a charismatic and protective person who cares for the wellbeing of her fellow students. She is not afraid to stand up to any potential threat, using her charisma to intimidate.

She also has a softer side, particularly regarding Joro. She is good-hearted and sincere but prideful, which leads to her showing traits of a typical tsundere.

She is also honourable and kind, as evidenced by her feeling guilty after finding out that the article about Joro was fake and this feeling like she not only needed to apologize but also do something in return for him as well. She's also shy around Joro which often leads to her friends pushing her to talk to Joro alone, like the times they took her to Joro's work or when she was about to ask him to go the amusement park with her.

Tsubaki is a kind and helpful person who is charismatic and confident when speaking and she is very professional in her work and takes it seriously.

After meeting Joro, she was stunned at how far he was willing to go to help his friend, Sun. By coincidence, she transferred into his class, and she decided she would help him embrace his role as a main character rather than letting his inferiority complex control him.

She is not infatuated with Joro, although she does get flustered when Joro compliments her, and (platonically) swears her eternal devotion to him by kissing his hand.

Hair Color: Blonde/Flaxen
Eye Color: Caramel
Height: 155 cm
Birthday: December 6th

Mahiru's appearance is consistently described as beautiful. Her straight, well-groomed, flaxen blond hair is silky smooth and lustrous. Her large caramel-colored eyes are framed by long lashes on both the top and bottom. Additionally, she has pale, milky-white skin that is soft and flawless, and a shapely nose.

Her clothing choices are trendy yet high-quality and practical. They are modest and not too revealing, reflecting her humble and unassuming personality.

Due to her parents' abandonment, both physically and emotionally, Mahiru was raised by Koyuki-san, a housekeeper. This has made her very withdrawn, much like a lone flower in an unreachable place. She hides her thoughts and feelings behind a figurative mask, appearing angelic but distant. Mahiru excels in cooking, impressing Amane, his friends, and his parents. She is also very organized, practical, and frugal, easily managing household tasks. 

Mahiru excels both academically and athletically, often ranking at the top of her class with perfect scores. She is a tireless worker who strives to make her achievements seem effortless. 

Mahiru is an innocent, cute, kind, and loving person with a strong moral compass and a deep generosity. She goes out of her way to help others when she feels safe doing so. While she maintains a guarded demeanor, especially regarding her parents, she avoids lying and tends to become reserved or cold when discussing past trauma. Her private honesty emerges more clearly when she is alone, though she never expresses it harshly.

Mahiru has some social awkwardness, particularly in close relationships, often making gestures that might be misinterpreted. She also struggles with self-confidence and is often surprised by, and relieved from, genuine compliments from Amane.

Mahiru, being the most popular girl at school, primarily interacts with other female students due to the frequent and unwanted attention from boys who are infatuated with her. She dislikes this attention and is cautious about trusting strangers. To keep people at a distance and protect her privacy, she readily lies or obfuscates the details of her life. Despite these efforts, she maintains an impeccable image, always appearing polite and humble about her achievements, which further reinforces her perfect reputation among her peers.

Sakuta Azusagawa (梓川 咲太, Azusagawa Sakuta) is the main male protagonist of the Seishun Buta Yarou series. He is incredibly selfless, kind and helpful, but also very snarky. He has a very similar personality to Mai: both are quick-witted, with a sarcastic streak, yet very kind and helpful, with an excellent heart, and always do what's right.

Sakuta's most iconic trait is his consistent deadpan face and manner of speech regardless of his emotional state. He will often voice whatever he has on his mind with a calm demeanor. Sakuta is a socially isolated and calm individual as a result of his ordeal with Adolescence Syndrome. 

While he states that he is not bothered by what people think about him, or care about trying to fit in and be accepted by his classmates, he does admit that rumors about him are sometimes quite painful to hear. Nonetheless, he states that he doesn't care if the whole world would hate him, as long as one person would need him, and isn't hesitant about defying social norms.

Sakuta is also not afraid to show his perverted side and will often make blunt and straightforward lewd remarks to the girls he interacts with. However, these comments are mostly jokes he directs at others and are by no means ill intended.

Affiliation: Minegahara High School, 3rd year

Mai Sakurajima (桜島 麻衣, Sakurajima Mai) is the main character of the Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai series. She is a notable actress/model and a third year at Minegahara High School, the same school as Sakuta Azusagawa.

Mai is a serious individual, especially around Sakuta Azusagawa. She is very sensitive, polite, levelheaded, helpful, and kind. She isn't harsh by default, but she can become easily annoyed and come across as somewhat snappy or violent especially to Sakuta. Mai tends to ignore and stuff down unpleasant feelings rather than deal with them. Sakuta often points out that she is ""dishonest"", often lying about her feelings. Despite her snarkiness, she's pure-hearted and even shy around Sakuta's jokes. Mai is also very intelligent; she's implied to have very good grades and even helps Sakuta study at one point. 

Mai found early fame as a model for television, magazines, and books due to the fact that her mother ran a photographing agency. While she did enjoy her job as a model in the show business, the pressure of being in the public began to take its toll on her. After being tricked and forced to participate in a swimsuit photoshoot by her mother in her early school years, Mai realized she was simply being used as a tool to make her mother easy money and took a hiatus from acting as a way to get back at her, deciding to attend highschool. 

However, because of work commitments made prior to her decision to go on hiatus she wasn't able to attend school until half-way through her first year. By then, social circles had formed, making her the ""odd one out"" and causing her to be isolated. As a result, the student body didn't know how to deal with her; While they had no reason to bully her, they also feared associating with her would cause themselves to be isolated as well.



Two years and several months since beginning her hiatus, Mai went to a library wearing a bunny costume to see if anyone would notice her. She then came across a boy named Sakuta Azusagawa, who was the only person in the building able to see her. After introducing themselves, however, Mai ordered Sakuta to forget about her.

Rio Futaba (双葉 理央, Futaba Rio) is one of the main characters of the Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai series, who is a second-year student at Minegahara High School. She had been in the same class as Sakuta and Yuuma during their first year and is the sole member of the Science Club.

She is a stoic and blunt girl who possesses substantial knowledge in science, including chemistry and quantum physics. She has a sharp sense of humor and is even more sarcastic and straightforward than Sakuta. Despite her stoic nature, Rio also shows various emotions such as love, as holds affection toward Yuuma, as well as anxiousness. She's also genuinely kind and loves her friends.

Rio is implied to have experienced a form of neglect. In addition, she has no siblings, which further proves that she chooses to be alone as this is her comfort zone that she unwillingly developed thanks to her lonely childhood. Although, this loneliness is what gave her the courage to approach Sakuta first when they were in the same class, as she saw him as an outcast just like her.

Before experiencing it herself, she was unwilling to believe the existence of Adolescence Syndrome, but she did acknowledge the abnormal phenomenon it induces and connects them with various scientific theories and principles.

At some point in time, Rio's feminine body parts had developed much earlier than her classmates. Once she discovered the way some boys were ogling her, she began to hate her body and felt like ""a truly filthy being.""

At some point during her time in the science club, she would come to be known for performing experiments that caused power outages as well as small fires.

Saki's primary concern is her popularity at school; Saki assumed Sakuta's status as a loner would lower Yuuma's reputation and hers as well.

In later episodes, it's revealed that she has a sister that she's often compared to by her parents, causing Saki to develop low self-esteem because of it. Sakuta realized this is why she is very protective of Kunimi's image and her own because her self-image in her eyes is already fragile.

Tomoe has a solid desire to fit in and avoid being shunned, so she bears unease over her past and why she cares about her social life and status; the latter is why she is usually on her phone. After her experience with Sakuta, she learned not to focus on what others think of her and thanked him for helping her grow as a person.

During her time in a middle school in Fukuoka, Tomoe was a bumpkin who hung out with an unnoticed group in her class. However, her father was relocated, which forced her to move to Tokyo. Fearing she would be considered uncool and get bullied, she began wearing makeup, styled her hair in a fancy salon, and wore clothes from fashion magazines. She became satisfied with the result.

Kaori Miyazono is one of the main protagonists of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. She is a violinist who helps Kousei Arima return to the piano world after his mother's death.

Kaori Miyazono is a free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects on her personality. She is independent, unpredictable, and short-tempered. It is also touched upon that she is passive aggressive at times. Kaori likes to depend on herself and only herself and can be seen as more of a support for others.

While considered a really sloppy violin player from a technical standpoint, such as not following music score sheets the way they are written, Kaori is an amazing violinist. Noted by one of the judges at Towa Hall during the first competition of the series, her pure abilities far exceed the others in the competition. She wields a free spirited style of performance that emphasizes emotions and artistry over the pure mechanics of music, such playing to specific tempos and dynamics originally intended by the composer. Her style of music is what rekindles Kousei's passion for the piano and inspires him to redefine himself as a musician.

In addition, she has the ability to play the melodica and has had some experience playing the piano.

Being with Kousei for a long time, Tsubaki gradually took on the role as an ""older sister."" Kousei was that ""useless little brother she just had to take care of."" Rather than the music type, Tsubaki was the athletic type. She was on the softball team in both middle school and high school along with her senpai from middle school where she enjoyed the sport a lot.

Nagi maintains a realistic look in life and repeatedly testifies her hate for cliché. Because of her unerring piano skills, she is slightly arrogant and claims herself as ""Angel of Kurumi Junior High"". Nagi also appears to have a distaste for anyone who refers to their superiors without the appropriate honorific, as shown when Miike did not refer to Kousei Arima as his Sensei or Senpai, instead addressing him directly as ""Arima.""

Nagi is often seen to have a brother-complex, seeming to be completely fixated on her brother Takeshi. This complex has driven her to follow in his footsteps in order to get him to notice her and to also stop her brother's own fixation on Kousei.

Takeshi is one of the best piano players of his generation, as mentioned for being invited to Europe for competitions and winning the majority of recent piano competitions in Japan. 

It was shown that prior to the storyline, Takeshi and Emi Igawa are sitting together complaining about the ""emotionless"" Kousei after losing to him in a piano competition. The rest of the crowd points out that Takeshi and Emi are head and shoulders above the rest of the competition, which makes Kousei all the more invincible for beating the two. In the storyline, it is shown that Takeshi looked up to Kousei as a hero, and constantly practiced in order to surpass Kousei.

Over the course of the story, Emi seeks to oppose the ""boring"" playing style of the old Kousei in hopes to find the ""true"" Kousei once again.

His hobbies include camping in the mountains surrounding Tokyo-3 and playing at simulated war reenacting—by himself. Kensuke solidifies his friendship with Shinji after Shinji saves him and Toji during the fight against the fourth Angel, Shamshel. Kensuke dreams of becoming an Eva pilot and ceaselessly begs Shinji to pull strings in NERV so he can be selected as a pilot, despite Shinji telling him that he has no say in the matter. He also seems oblivious to the intense physical and psychological duress endured by Eva pilots. Nevertheless, Kensuke enjoys the privileges of being the friend of an Eva pilot; he and Toji accompany Shinji on the excursion to the UN combined naval fleet during the transportation of Unit 02. Like presumably every one of Shinji's classmates, Kensuke's mother is deceased. Like Toji, Kensuke has a crush on Misato Katsuragi. He is rarely seen without his camcorder at hand.


Kensuke is named after a main character in the novel The Fascism of Love and Fantasies (Ai to Gensou no Fascism) by Ryu Murakami. He is also similar in appearance to the character Jean, from Hideaki Anno's earlier anime Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water.

Ritsuko Akagi is NERV's head scientist and is heavily involved in the repairs and maintenance of Tokyo-3's defenses against the Angels, particularly the Evas.

She is the daughter of Naoko Akagi, the developer of the MAGI supercomputer system which controls Nerv. In many ways, Ritsuko is living in the shadow of her mother, whom she both admires and despises. Naoko was the head scientist working on the Evangelion project before her death, and Ritsuko is continuing the work her mother began with the Evas, as well as continuing the development of the Magi supercomputer system. Flashbacks to a teenaged Ritsuko reveal that she is a natural brunette, just like her mother.

Ritsuko is extremely intelligent, with a strong dedication to her work and a stoic, detached attitude which is frequently contrasted against Misato Katsuragi's hot-headness, especially during Eva combat. Her occasional jibes at Misato are a source of comic relief in the series. She has a great affinity for cats, and Misato chides her at one point for substituting her cats for human affection. She also is a heavy smoker, as evidenced by an ashtray on her desk filled with cigarette butts stained by her lipstick.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/108139.jpg,760,anime,30

However, after Rei I called her an ""old hag"" and said that Gendo himself called Naoko that frequently, she realized that he had merely been using her affections to ensure her performance for him. In a fit of rage, Naoko strangled Rei to death and then either committed suicide or was murdered by an unknown assailant. Soon afterward, Gehirn was disbanded and the organization Nerv was formed in its place. In vol. 10 of the manga, Naoko is shown to commit suicide after killing Rei I. Ritsuko witnesses both Rei's murder and Naoko's suicide.

There is no indication given during the series of any romantic relationships or of any dependents. In the episode The Birth of NERV, in several flashbacks, a few of his students and the superior professor at his institute (who first suggests that he take on the young and brilliant Yui Ikari as a research assistant) suggest that he be more sociable; this hints at Fuyutsuki being a classically withdrawn academic, and possibly a life-long bachelor. Shortly after beginning his academic (and platonically affectionate and supportive) association with Yui Ikari, he was directed by his institution's superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with the then Gendo Rokoboungi.

Given later revelations about apparent decades-long behind-the-scenes machinations of SEELE into all aspects of the sciences directly and indirectly involved in the subject of Instrumentality (the Dead Sea Scrolls were uncovered in 1947, so presumably the world-wide conspiracy behind SEELE's operations had been in existence for only slightly less time) it is safe to say that Professor Fuyutsuki had been monitored by and targeted for recruitment by SEELE early in his career. If speculations regarding Yui actually having been a junior member of SEELE through her father's influence are correct, then Fuyutsuki's association with Gendo Rokoboungi/Ikari was equally planned well in advance. His earlier introduction to Rokoboungi/Ikari by taking him on as a research assistant, bailing him out of jail, and later meeting him again after Second Impact during a research expedition to the area formerly occupied by Antarctica may be seen as steps in a testing procedure to determine his reliability, discretion and intelligence at being able to surmise SEELE's goals...and whether he would actually be amenable to that recruitment.

Fuyutsuki's earlier assessment of Gendo Ikari's personality (in the Director's Cut, the subtitle during Fuyutsuki's recall of the initial meeting at the police station refers to Rokoboungi/Ikari as 'real bastard') was reinforced by the Antarctic mission, during which Fuyutsuki began to suspect that the now Gendo Ikari's associates in SEELE may be more powerful and dangerous than he originally realized. The seed of doubt planted during that voyage led to the discovery of the true nature of the events leading up to Second Impact and SEELE's involvement in initiating that catastrophe.

After Fuyutsuki threatened to expose Gendo to the public, regarding the massive deception concerning Second Impact, in 2003 (through his own research), Gendo Ikari led him into the GeoFront and Central Dogma and revealed to him an incomplete prototype Eva. At that point, Ikari asked Fuyutsuki to join him and ""create a new future for humankind, together with me."" Fuyutsuki accepted this, and started to help Gendo. Whether this agreement was entirely out of idealism or more from self-preservation is not made clear. In the movie The End of Evangelion it is mentioned that SEELE had threatened Fuyutsuki with being 'disappeared'; the implication is that this recruitment may have been a Hobson's Choice.

Despite Fuyutsuki's initial dislike of Gendo, it is clearly evident that he becomes the closest thing that Gendo has to a confidant in the series. In many episodes, Fuyutsuki may be seen as a sort of external conscience for Gendo Ikari; despite his somewhat gruff nature, Fuyutsuki is genuinely concerned for those under his commend, but having the added knowledge of SEELE's true goals for Instrumentality, must balance his compassion with Ikari's ruthlessness in pursuing both SEELE's agenda and Ikari's own hidden one of re-uniting with his discarnate Yui. Ikari's dependence upon Fuyutsuki as both confidant and his chief lieutenant is shown by the many times that Fuyutski takes the initiative for action without waiting for direction from Ikari.

As had been mentioned and implied in the series, while obviously kindly disposed towards Yui, at all times Fuyutsuki maintained a professional demeanor towards her. It is not intimated how the Destrudo experiment that 'killed' her and ensconced her soul into EVA Unit 01 affected him. The depth of his feelings for her, however, is revealed when immediately prior to dematerializing into LCL during Instrumentality, Fuyutsuki witnesses an image of Lilith-as-Yui which appears to float down to embrace him, comforting him in his transition to a non-corporeal state.

1254,Hikari Horaki,洞木 ヒカリ,,"Age: 13 
Birthday: January 25, 2002
Known Relatives: Kodama (older sister), Nozomi (younger sister)

Hikari Horaki (洞木 ヒカリ Horaki Hikari) is the class representative of the class that Shinji and the other Eva pilots attend. Like all of her classmates, she is an unknowing Eva pilot candidate. She has a by-the-book demeanor and takes her responsibilities as ""class rep"" seriously. Although she frequently bickers with Toji, she reveals to Asuka that she has an enormous crush on Toji but is unable to openly express her feelings to him. She also appears to be Asuka's only friend. After the battle with Arael, Asuka seeks out Hikari and stays with her for an unspecified time. During a late evening she reveals her inner insecurities to Hikari, a testament to their friendship; however, Hikari appears saddened by the hateful words Asuka uses.

Hikari is an accomplished cook who appears to take care of her two sisters. Like presumably every one of Shinji's classmates, Hikari's mother is deceased. No references are made as to whether her father is either.

Like Kensuke, Hikari is named after a character in the novel The Fascism of Love and Fantasies (Ai to Gensou no Fascism) by Ryu Murakami. Her name, and that of her unseen younger sister, Nozomi, and elder sister, Kodama, is also in reference to the names of the trains of the Tokaido Shinkansen line.

1256,Maya Ibuki,伊吹 マヤ,,"Affiliation(s): NERV
Rank: First Lieutenant
Age: 24
Birthday: July 11, 1991

Maya Ibuki is a First Lieutenant at NERV and a computer technician who works primarily with Ritsuko Akagi. Her main role during the fights with the Angels is to constantly monitor the Eva pilots’ synchronization ratios and send various emergency commands to the Evangelions as ordered by Misato or Gendo. Her implementation scene during the The End of Evangelion movie has been read by many fans as a revelation that she is secretly in love with Ritsuko. When Maya's Instrumentality occurs, Lilith (in the form of Ritsuko) types ""I need you"" into Maya's laptop and embraces her. Maya's reversion to LCL comes after an ecstatic gasp of ""Senpai!"" However, this scene is the only one that alludes to her possible feelings towards Ritsuko, and its intention is not clear. In spite of her profession, Maya despises violence of any sort, and is frequently shown becoming nauseous and averting her eyes during battles with the Angels. Notably, in The End of Evangelion, Maya is the only NERV officer who is shown refusing to fight back against the JSSDF invaders. She rejects the gun Shigeru hands her to defend herself saying ""I can't shoot this thing"", not because she is unskilled, but because she has never shot it at a human being. Throughout much of the second half of End of Evangelion Maya is seen with her face buried in a pink pillow under her desk.

She is sometimes described as representing the audience's views throughout the series, as she shows revulsion when it would be most likely for the viewer to do the same, and delight in other, more light-hearted scenes.

Yui Ikari is one of the more powerful presences in the series, Yui is shown to be kind, optimistic, and motherly. Her faith in humanity and belief that it is worth preserving and remembering stand out when compared to the more cynical characters on the rest of the cast.

Yui became romantically involved with a mysterious man, several years older than herself, named Gendo Rokubungi, who was constantly the source of shady rumors  among them that Gendo had approached Yui for nothing but her talent and her affiliation with Seele. Regardless, in Yui's own words, he was ""quite a sweet person. It's just that no one knows it.""
In the rebuild film series she's reffered to as Ayanami Yui instead of Ikari Yui




After Yui (presumably) graduated, she married Gendo, and the latter took on her surname He became involved with Seele, joining the Katsuragi Expedition to serve as an auditor, although it is not revealed what Yui was doing during this time. After Gendo returned, they had a child together, Shinji who, if a girl, would have been named Rei.

Minami Shiunji is one of the youngest Shiunji siblings, along with her twin brother Shion Shiunji. She is a first-year high school student, who is triple champion of the middle school tennis tournament and future Olympian.

Minami has short and spikey black hair with one spike in particular that is highlighted with a light green color on colored pages. She is one of the shortest Shiunji siblings, second only to Seiha Shiunji, and will pair her school uniform with a lime green sweater that she ties across her shoulders. She is the only sibling that doesn't wear socks that are visible past her school shoes. Like her twin brother, she has a more androgynous appearance. Unlike the rest of her s sisters she is more often seen in athletic wear, short or more casual clothing, with Arata being suprised when she wore a skirt.

Minami is very cheerful and spritely, as well as arguably the most athletically talented of the Shiunji siblings. She is considered a child prodigy at tennis and has been scouted several times by professionals since she started entering and winning multiple middle school tennis competitions. It's believed that she will one day compete in the Olympics. Despite all of her athletic achievements, however, she is the only Shiunji sibling to struggle greatly in academics, even having trouble with simple addition. Unlike her sisters, many of Minami's fans within the Shiunji fan club are girls.
She has been described by Aarata as the funnest Shiunji sibling to be around, and is often seen with a smile on her face. While naturally positive she does have a habit of hiding her emotions when something bad happens, trying to maintain an outward demeanor so that it won't affect those around her.

Kotono Shiunji is the youngest sibling of the Shiunji family and the only one that's still in middle school. She is a third-year middle school student, who is the type of innocent girl that has a peaceful and shy personality.

Kotono Shiunji is a petite girl with a gentle and shy presence. She has medium-length black hair, with long bangs that cover her right eye, and wears a yellow scrunchie on the left side. Her eyes are a soft golden-amber color, often giving her a timid look.

She wears her school uniform with a light yellow pleated skirt, a lavender cardigan over her top, and a blue sailor collar tied with a yellow neckerchief. She completes the look with navy knee-high socks and brown loafers. Her posture and expression usually reflect her reserved and quiet nature.

Kotono tends to be very shy and meek, rarely looking up from the ground. Because of this, she's one of the most popular girls in the Shiunji Sister fan club. However, there's one thing that can make her act more brashly than most would expect - her romantic feelings for her older brother Arata Shiunji. She has been told multiple times that she must simply be confusing platonic affection for her brother with romantic love, but she refuses to think otherwise. The same night that she learned that they were not related by blood, she looked up the laws regarding marriage between adopted siblings and then proceeded to ambush Arata with a second confession in the bathroom, despite already being rejected once before, only to be rejected yet again.

Banri is the second tallest of the Shiunji siblings, only slightly shorter than her younger brother Arata Shiunji. She has purple eyes and strawberry blonde hair that is styled into a bob, with one chunk of hair on her left side running down to just past her collar bones and held together with a ponytail cuff. The right side of her hair is brushed behind her ear to reveal a gold dangle earing. Her chest is very large, which seems to be an assest that she is very proud of. She is normally seen in skirts and a fashionable top, and almost always with a necklace with a purple centrepiece.

Both cheerful and mature, Banri seems very satisfied with how her life is going and is often the person to calm everyone down and better identify people's feelings. She is currently enrolled in a prestigious university and hopes to become a nurse. She is said to be the most popular girl in her university, as well as in the fan club for the Shiunji sisters. It is stated that when they were younger, Banri was the person that would always help protect Arata from their other sisters, who enjoyed picking on both him and their other brother Shion Shiunji.

She has been described as both motherly and mature, as well at times childish by Arata. She has a habit of teasing him and acting coy in public, to his embarassment and her amusement.

Seemingly the most laid-back siblings, Shion is mostly shown playing video games on a portable device and/or trying to not get himself involved in complicated situations. Althoug he gives advice to his older brother Arata, when asked, he doesn't seem too bothered to help him without being prompted. In chapter one, he openly admits to only having sex just to see what it feels like. A female classmate, presumably his girlfriend Yuu, is seen wrapped around his arm in the background.

Amongst his siblings, he shows the greatest interest in searching for his birth parents. Upon finding out he was born in Karuizawa, where the Shiunji family has a vacation home, he explored the town to find more information about their whereabouts but was unable to get any leads.

She is so book smart that she can come off as cold and distant, tackling almost every problem as logically as possible. At times, this logical approach to everything can go to extremes and make the people around her uncomfortable, but she doesn't see to notice this.

Despite this, the two share a close bond and it's stated that they had many moments in their childhood where their thoughts and actions were so in sync that friends assumed that it must be some kind of twin psychic connection.

Arata Shiunji is the main protagonist of The Shiunji Family Children series. He is one of the third oldest Shiunji siblings, along with his ""twin sister"" Oka Shiunji and he is a second-year high school student.

Arata has short, slightly spiked, dark brown hair and the bottom half of the back of his head is shaved. He is the tallest of the Shiunji siblings, and has a strong build from working out. His eyes are narrow, emphasized by his thick eyebrows that are almost always slated downwards.

Arata is very protective of his family and caring to his siblings, perhaps in part due to the burden he feels from being the eldest male son and the heir to the Shiunji fortune. Despite his rather sharp and almost aggressive looking facial features, he gets flustered very easily. Arata is shown to carefully think out his words and actions, though his intentions are frequently misunderstood. He usually turns towards his brother Shion for advice, even though he's younger than him. Each time one of his sisters comes after him in a sexual or romantic manner, whether jokingly or seriously, he is very quick to turn them down and reiterate that they are all siblings regardless of blood relation.

On top of the situation with his family, he's also been struggling with one-sided feelings as the girl he has a crush on, Rara Yakoyama, already has a boyfriend. Scared to make a move beforehand, he now has no idea whether or not it would still be a good idea to approach her. It's unknown if Rara even knows he exists, as he always hides when he sees her and is too scared to even send her a friend request.

Height: at least 180 cm (5""11)
Birthday: March 21

Wakana is quite tall for his age, standing at least 180 centimeters. When Marin asked him his height, he was interrupted before he could finish saying, meaning that he may be taller than 180cm. He has short, black hair and gray eyes, along with a tiny mole on the outer lower corner of his right eye.

Outside of his school uniform, he is always wearing a samue, a general work outfit consisting of a blue suit jacket and pants, with a simple white shirt underneath. He wears wooden sandals and wears a white headband while working. He tends to have it over his shoulders when not wearing his headband.

At the start of the series, Wakana was a withdrawn person in high school, having no friends and a secret love and admiration for hina dolls.His solitary attitude makes him rather submissive with others. Wakana is rather shy and modest, not doing well with embarrassing or lewd topics. Wakana doesn't appear to have much of a life outside of his grandfather's store and helping Marin, as he always wears his work attire outside of his school uniform, and often spends his free time either sewing or painting hina doll faces.

He stands at a shorter height than his grandson, Wakana, and is slightly hunched over as well. He wears the same kind of work outfit as Wakana (a samue) along with glasses, and black-laced sandals.

Kaoru is a caring grandfather towards Wakana, having looked after him since the death of his parents. He is shown to be passionate and loving towards the art of creating hina dolls and supports his grandson in his goal to become a kashira-shi (hina doll maker) like him.

Kaoru is dedicated to his hina doll art and takes it very seriously, saying that should he miss even a single day's work, it would take three days for him just to regain that level of practice.

193037,Sajuna Inui,乾 紗寿叶,Juju,"Age: 17
Birthday: June 1

Sajuna possesses a petite, child-like appearance, smooth pale skin, pale pink hair, and large hazel eyes that are framed by an array of long eyelashes . She wears her hair half in pigtails and half long, and her clothes are a red serafuku (sailor suit) with a yellow bow, and long black knee socks. 

Sajuna is rather headstrong and blunt, despite her child-like appearance.  She has no problem with chiding others or speaking harshly when it comes to it, and can be quick to lose her temper as well. She is shown to take cosplaying seriously and loves dressing up as characters she adores. Despite her popularity online, Sajuna isn't interested in fame and admits that she only cosplays for herself and by herself.

Sajuna is willing to go to great lengths if it means getting what she's after. While blunt, she is perfectly capable of being genuinely polite and friendly, coming to get along with Wakana and Marin, and clearly caring for her younger sister, Shinju. She is shown to have a fear of thunder and scary places but does her best to try and hide it. 

Furthermore, as a student attending an all-girls school, she is shown to be completely inexperienced with the opposite sex,

Sajuna is shown to have reluctance in expressing how she really feels about certain things, likening her to a tsundere.

Shinju is described as a relatively tall girl for her age. Like her sister, she possesses pale pink hair that falls at the length of her upper back. But instead of possessing sharp hazel-colored eyes like the latter, Shinju's eyes are more droopy and light brown in color.

Given her towering stature and ample bosom, her appearance would leave those to assume that she's an adult, when in reality, she's only a middle schooler.

Unlike her sister, who is rather blunt and headstrong, Shinju is a timid yet kind-hearted girl. She is shown to get nervous easily, especially when meeting new people, as seen during her first meeting with Gojo and Marin. This aside, Shinju strongly admires and loves her sister, working as her cosplay photographer while also creating an online account to share her sister's work. Shinju likes the Flower Princess Blaze alongside Sajuna and Marin. Her favorite character from the series is the older brother Soma, due to his caring nature, as he reminds Shinju of her sister.

Shinju is aware of her mature figure, particularly her chest, and is shown to get embarrassed about it. She also calls herself ""fat"" in the Japanese dub of the anime.

Like her friends and ""big"" sister, she is also interested in trying out cosplay but, contrary to the others, she wishes to cosplay as a boy. Her big chest, however, has proven to be a hurdle in achieving this.

Marin Kitagawa is a big fan of her, so much so that she wanted to cosplay as her, which also was her cosplay debut. She had tally marks up to 17 on her thighs, which is indicating how many sexual encounters the character had, so it is possible as the more sex you had in the game the more tally marks would be added to the character's thighs in the game.

184947,Frieren,フリーレン,Frieren the Slayer,"Frieren was a mage in Hero Himmel's party. They travelled along with Priest Heiter and Warrior Eisen in a ten-year journey to defeat the Demon King. She was the last member to be recruited to the party and, despite Heiter's initial impression of her mana being average, Himmel had a hunch she was the most powerful mage he had ever met.

Being an elf that has lived for over a thousand years, Frieren has a hard time forming meaningful relationships with humans because of the difference in their lifespans and how they perceive the passage of time. This generally manifests itself as laziness, since missing an important event is of no importance as she will have plenty of opportunities to relive it in the future, or as a nearly sociopathic inability to comprehend human's feelings. For instance, she tends to not notice how her lack of impatience or cold statements can affect humans around her. Her party members have also frequently stated that they can't comprehend her feelings or read what goes on in her head.

Despite being an extremely powerful mage, Frieren has the habit of collecting rare and daily usage centered magic, like magic that can polish a bronze statue or make flowers bloom. She always asks for a grimoire as a reward even if she already knows its contents or when it comes to The Great Mage Flamme's lost grimoires knows they are fakes.

After the deaths of Hero Himmel and Priest Heiter, Frieren decided she wants to learn more about humans. She is currently traveling with Fern her pupil who was a war refugee left in her care by Priest Heiter in a quest to Ende, the place where souls reside in the northernmost tip of the continent and where the Demon King's Castle was built to try and speak to Himmel's soul. In her new journey, Frieren visits many places her old party travelled through in the past and relives memories, slowly understanding more about their meaning and her feelings.

Ironically, Fern is generally the one to take care of Frieren in daily activities despite being far younger.

In the real world, he lives with his aunt and younger cousin in a family of 3.

When Kayaba announced the start of the death game, he is surprised, but unlike everyone else, he quickly gets over it and accepts it to an extent. He invited his friend Klein to go with him but Klein had to find his friends in the game. He was invited to join them but he declined as he couldn't take the pressure of protecting them even with his beta testing knowledge of the game.

Shino is a skilled VRMMO player. She goes by the name Sinon in Gun Gale Online and ALfheim Online. She is nicknamed Hecate, after her gun «PGM Ultima Ratio Hecate II», a .50 caliber anti-materiel and rare sniper rifle. She is one of the main characters of volumes five and six and first female player that Kirito meets in GGO. She plays GGO to overcome her trauma concerning guns.

Calm and cool are two words that best describe Sinon's personality. In battle and most of the time in the game, she keeps a cool head that actually makes other female players admire her; however, Sinon has a violent temper once angered—something that is best seen with her interactions with Kirito. It is actually said that Kirito is the first one to make her extremely angry. Despite all this, Sinon, while may be hard to approach, is generally a friendly person and doesn't mind helping others.

Her favorite tea and drink is Rose Hip tea. She even has a flowery, rose motif, wearing many frilly flowery casual and stage outfits.

She enjoys teasing Nao, as she notes Nao chooses her clothes and costumes with the Producer in mind. Momoka also really likes the glasses Haruna gave her and enjoys selecting kimonos with friends. She holds the Producer in very high regard and shows that she will put herself on the line in order to show him that she cares about him.

Momoka is close friends with Arisu, starting from the Near to You event commu in Starlight Stage. Being the twelve-year-old Hyougo idols, both of them view each other as rivals, duking out who's the leader for the song (which belongs to Sanae instead). After a numerous battle lessons, during the festival, Momoka thinks that Arisu is not just as a worthy rival, but also a comrade and a dear friend with the same vision of becoming a better person. Ever since the Near to You event commu concluded, Momoka will occasionally be seen with Arisu, both encouraging Nina face to face in order to come back as an idol after her father's departure, as well as going to the party to meet Fumika in the ending of the Illusionista! event commu.

Chie is an elementary school student who acts shy upon meeting new people but later becomes very mature around Producer. Chie is very easily scared of people she doesn’t know, and in fact, was actually terrified of Producer at first. However, once she begins to trust others, Chie becomes very level-headed and mature, even flirty, after idol work. She admits that she doesn’t trust in her idol skills, and has been found out to have developed a crush on Producer by the time she receives her first idol form.

In the tie-in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Chie shows that she still believes that theme park mascots are real. She likes to wear kimonos and has fun with Seika Suzumiya at the band event. She plays the pianica at her school and hopes to be able to play in a marching band someday. When told she would lead her fellow idols in a marching band unit, she immediately got nervous and begins to hope Producer will march right beside her. Chie partakes in singing lessons with Chika Yokoyama and Mai Fukuyama, with Arisa Mochida leading them. She admits that she doesn’t have any special skills, although she can play the whistle. She is also very proud of her ice and flower arrangement, made from a bucket.

Haru is a former rival idol who enjoys soccer. She has a harsh, no holds barred personality. Considered to be a tomboy and delinquent, Haru uses the pronoun ""ore,"" which is barely used by females. She doesn't like cute clothes and shows extreme displeasure when forced into a bunny costume for an event. Haru has been shown performing with Hiromi Seki and Yuu Oota during lives.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Gekijou skits, Haru is initially introduced by Cathy Graham. She is very annoyed at becoming an idol, and her first event is a bunny girl live. She immediately protests upon learning that she will have to wear the costume, and only puts it on due to it being her job. Haru is quick to dismantle the silly fun other idols have, but sometimes allows it when in certain situations, notably when with Yuki Himekawa and Nene Kurihara. She has been a participant in ""free running"" with the Producer, and promotes it with Yuriko Oonishi.

When asked about it, she says her dream changed to caring much more about being an idol since she was scouted. She also admits that she'd like to experience many new things.

With her sleek black hair and her imposing school uniform, Shibuya Rin is a cool and trendy schoolgirl. She lives in a flower shop, where she’ll occasionally help her parents over the counter. Though her aloof demeanor makes her seem like the type of person that’s hard to approach, Rin shows a more honest side once she’s more trusting of others.

Her rise in popularity and her being the first one to go from a tutorial idol to getting a CD debut has earned quite a bit of popularity, becoming sort of the poster girl for the Cinderella Girls.

Rin tends to be the “straight man” in joke sequences, and is sometimes overly serious to a comedic point. While she tends to be cool and harsh, she does have a sweet side that she occasionally shows others. She is self-conscious that her default expression comes off as unfriendly. Her cool, level-headed demeanor is put to the test when she's stuck in the same room as Ranko Kanzaki, Kaede Takagaki and Riina Tada.

She attends Tokiwadai Middle School, a famous girls' school for the rich and elite psychics and one of the five elite schools of Academy City. To most people, she is considered a proper lady, but in reality, she has a short-tempered, prideful, and improper attitude with some tomboyish tendencies and insecurities, a fact few other characters know. She is fond of cute, childish things, such as flowery pajamas and Gekota, the popular frog mascot franchise. She has a strong sense of morals and hates injustice, contrary to what she claims. Her power is to generate electricity; she is powerful enough to cause a blackout in the city, make instant railguns by using coins as projectiles, and use electricity to magnetically attract iron particles around her into a chain-sword whip. She can also manipulate electrical objects such as networks and security systems. She has a one-sided rivalry with Touma, who nicknames her ""Biribiri"" (ビリビリ, relating to the sound of an electric shock), ever since their first meeting before the events of the first novel when he first dissipated her electricity. Since that incident, she is always trying to have a proper match with Touma and defeat him despite his many attempts to avoid conflict with her.

She is classified as Mikoto Misaka's best friend. Her power is instant teleportation, which allows her to teleport herself and anything in her possession as long it weighs under around 130-137 kilograms to anywhere in a radius of around 81-85 meters. She generally carries a strap of needles around her leg that she can teleport to pin down enemies. One disadvantage of her power is that she has to concentrate on where she, the object(s), and/or person she holds would be teleported to, for any disturbance in her concentration will make her powers useless.

13699,Index Librorum Prohibitorum,禁書目録,Dedicatus545,"Age: 14-15
Height: 148 cm
Classification: Magician

Index, also known by her full name Index Librorum Prohibitorum (禁書目録, ""List of Prohibited Books""), is one of the main heroines and the titular character of the series. She is a young nun from Necessarius (必要悪の教会, Hitsuyouaku no Kyoukai, ""Church of Necessary Evil""), a branch of the Church of England. Index is small in stature and has a petite build. About 14 or 15 years old, she has thigh-length, silvery-blue hair with very white skin and large green eyes. She also wears a white robe with golden embroidery sewed onto every edge of it, the Walking Church, that prevents any injury on her, but it is later destroyed by Touma when he touched it with his right hand, which is why her uniform is stitched with golden pins. Her mind has been implanted with the 103,000 magical texts of the Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum as she possesses Photographic memory, which makes magicians wonder if she really is human because just one grimoire is poisonous to the mind, and one is more than enough to kill a person without the proper preparative.


When she is being invaded by outsiders or injured, her self-protection system personality, Johann's Pen (自動書記〈ヨハネのペン〉, ""Automatic Writing""), will be activated to allow her to use magic to cast high-class magic attacks such as St. George's Sanctuary (聖ジョージの聖域) and Dragon's Breath (竜王の殺息〈ドラゴンブレス〉, ""Killing Breath of the Dragon King""). Her self-protection system will use the Feather of Light (光の羽, Hikari no Hane) to force a reset on Index's own memory should a manual reset fail to be performed. Although she does not know that she has magical powers, she can easily identify the types of magic by seeing it or somebody describing it to her and know how to counter them. Her vast knowledge of the Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum within her mind makes her to be one of the most powerful characters so far and becomes very helpful to her friends in various situations using skills like Spell Intercept (強制詠唱〈スペルインターセプト〉, ""Force Chant""), and Sheol Fear (魔滅の声〈シェオールフィア〉, ""Voice of Destruction of Evil"") and makes her a target of interest for many.

She is often elated by a variety of things and is slightly ignorant and curious of modern technology. She usually is gentle and polite with people and has a kind nature, but she is also easily irritated especially by Tōma who usually ends making her mad in some way as consequence of his bad luck which ends with her biting him. She also has an large appetite and uses any excuse to get food from anyone and likes watching an anime series called Magical Powered Kanamin.

Classification: Esper
Ability: Imagine Breaker (unique non-esper, non-magic ability)
Level: 0
Famous Quote: It's my dream to go back home smiling, without having lost anything.

He is the series' protagonist. He has the lowest psychic rank possible at Level 0—largely because the people testing psychic abilities cannot detect or classify his abilities. His power is Imagine Breaker (幻想殺し, ""Illusion/Fantasy Killer""), a power which negates all magic, psychic, or divine powers but also his own good luck. Due to the nature of his power, the founder of Academy City considers him neither a Psychic nor a Magician but rather a normal person with a unique ability.

He tends to stay away from trouble but possesses a strong sense of justice, albeit somewhat shallow and dogmatic. He is a smart student and knowledgeable about certain subjects yet is a failure in his esper studies. While he is an idealist for the hopes of other people, ironically he is cynical about himself possibly because of his powers.

Quote: ""Just because I've gotten weaker, it doesn't mean that you got stronger, right?""
Theme Song: ""Saikyou no Nanori""

Accelerator is the most powerful Psychic in Academy City and the main protagonist of Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator. His real name is unknown, though Accelerator recalls his surname was composed of two characters and his given name consisted of three characters. First appearing as an antagonist of the third light novel, he later becomes a main character and the lead of the science side in the Toaru Majutsu no Index series, especially in volumes 5, 8, 12, 13, SS1, SS2, 15, 14, 19, and 20.

A sadistic boy about the same age as Touma, he has an ability called ""Vector Change,"" a form of telekinesis allowing him to change the vector values of anything he touches due in part of having a thin coat of AIM fields surrounding his body. This ability allows Accelerator perform feats such as reversing the blood flow inside a person's body, increasing the wind velocity around him to create a massive plasma storm, and blocking sound. His ability is automatic, which means that he must consciously allow gravity to affect him and that his body blocks all ultraviolet radiation, resulting his albino appearance (white hair and pale skin) because his body is unable to make melanin. The automatic nature of Redirection also prevents the use of projectiles (like bullets) and explosives (like bombs) against him.

Accelerator's unique ability made him the subject of an experiment attempting to create the first Level 6 ESPer; according to the city's best supercomputer, Tree Diagram (which was unprecedentedly destroyed by Index's Dragon Breath), this feat could only be achieved by killing 128 skilled Level 5 ESPer without a single failure. Since there are only six other known Level 5s in Academy City, an alternative plan was formed to ""level up"" Accelerator by having him kill 20,000 skilled Level 3 ESPers: the Misaka clones. He willingly joins the experiment to gain a reputation as the most powerful and feared ESPer that no one would be foolish enough to challenge and even killed many who got in his way.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/569601.jpg,10923,anime,4654

Ellis was involved in a secret experiment 20 years ago between Academy City and a faction of Necessarius in an attempt to create the first magician-esper hybrid. But it failed as not only did the espers participants suffered major injuries from magic but were killed by the Knights of England as the experiment was illegal under the truce between Science and Magic. Blaming both sides for letting Ellis suffer and be killed, Sherry swore revenge against them by making them suffered like she did.

Weapon: Blasting Rod, Smartphone
Position: General Superintendent of Academy City

Based on the late Aleister Crowley. He was once the greatest magician in modern magic history, where more than half of all modern magicians are affected by this man's established theories, and two-fifths of them are direct followers of his ways. Aleister stretched the boundaries of sorcery farther than the advances made in the last few millennia alone and written many top-class spell books like The Book of the Law. His death in 1947 shocked many but it was not the last the world had heard of him. In reality he faked his death to stop his obsess fanatics following him and secretly went to Japan where he meet a doctor who he would later called Heaven Canceler. Years later, Aleister, Heaven Canceler and several powerful individuals combined their resources and influences to create one of the most technological advance city on Earth at western Tokyo, Academy City. By this time, rumors of Aleister still being alive led some mages to discover the truth. At first they were happy to see that he was alive but were immediately shocked as that not only Aleister abandoned using magic but was more interested in the study and development of ESPers.

To this day, only a few magicians know Aleister is still alive who are mostly the leaders of powerful magical organizations and their trusted followers and those that do know him view him with skepticism, curiosity on what he's doing or outraged for abandoning magic and supporting science especially ESPers studies. Not making things any better is the fact Aleister was responsible for the creation of the truce between Science and Magic where neither side is allowed to interfere in each other affairs which has irked both sides. As the 13th Board of Director and General Director of Academy City, Aleister has the final say of the city affairs but usually leaves the city's welfare to the other members of the board. He resides within a tall, gray building called The Windowless building, known for not having any exterior windows where access to the building is a secret to a few. In there, Aleister's body which has now become younger lies inside a giant glass tube, supported by machines made by Heaven Canceler that extended his lifespan where he plots his mysterious plans.

A month before August 31st, Etzali was sent to Academy City in order to judge if the growing Kamijou Faction was dangerous and if it would destroy the balance between the magic and science side.

Classification: Magician
Affiliation: Necessarius, Amakusa-Style Remix of Church (Priestess)

An eighteen year old magician from Necessarius. Unlike her partner Stiyl, she uses magic to magically strengthen her body. Her magic name is Salvare000. She uses a 2 meter long katana (which actually is a Nodachi) called Shichiten Shichitou (七天七刀), meaning, ""Seven Heavens Seven Swords"" as her weapon. She has a special attack called Nanasen (七閃), meaning ""Seven Flashes"", that uses 7 wires that can split into thousands to surround and cut her enemy. She used to be a kind person who treated Index like a sister, but when Index's memories were deleted by Necessarius, Kanzaki took on a cold and silent personality as Index no longer remembered her and consequentially did not trust her. After Touma saves Index's life and her current memories, she begins to feel a great sense of gratitude towards him.

Later in the series, more of her past is revealed. Not only is Kanzaki a skilled swordswoman, but she is a Saint, possessing the ""Stigma""—the ability to call upon God's power—as well as the former leader of the Amakusa Church. However, Kanzaki left the group as she felt that her incredible luck was in turn bringing misery to the people she cared about in the Amakusa. This led her to despise the concept of luck and fortune. She joined Necessarius in the hopes of changing her fate and befriended Index, developing a sisterly relationship with her. The repeated failed attempts to make Index remember her after each memory erasure resulted in her cold personality as Kanzaki began to accept that no matter how much a person tries, no one can change their destiny. She begins to show a kinder side to herself after Touma saves Index (thus giving her hope that anyone can defy their destiny) and gradually falls in love with him after he helps her face her past with the Amakusa Church, becoming more prone to showing emotion and sometimes showing a little embarrassment if she is with him. She is the protagonist of her own spin-off mini light novel bundled with the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun DVDs.

She looks the same as Mikoto, although for emphasis her eyes are drawn in a different way. Goggles and blue-striped panties are common to all Misaka clones and Misaka 10031 is no exception to this.

She has the same personality as most clones, with emotions that have been suppressed as they weren't beneficial to the experiment. Despite this, she still feels pain and is hurt when Mikoto drove her away when she tried to cheer her up, because of this she was a little saddened.

Another slight hint of personality is shown when behaves seriously when confronting Mikoto and Touma about having ""robbed"" a vending machine, she seriously recited every legal article that the couple ignored while committing the ""felony,"" expressing disappointment on them for engaging in such activities. Unfortunately 10031's nagging was cut short by Mikoto's aggressive personality which dragged her out of the scene to question her about the situation.

23512,Mitsuki Unabara,海原 光貴,,"Mitsuki is a friend of Misaka who seems to have a crush on her, though Misaka doesn't like him, and in order to get him away she and Touma pretend to be girlfriend and boyfriend.

He is the grandson of the principal of Mikoto's school.

During the events of the volume 5 his appareance is borrowed by the magician Etzali, which he fought and got defeated and then imprisoned about a week before the story starts, where is said he was harrasing Misaka Mikoto, revealing the contradictions of Etzali's alibies about practicing at the sports club and other during his talks with Kamijou Touma.

According to Shirai Kuroko investigations, he actually got his grades through cheating. His method is to put a thin layer of his ability on the computer screen for the exam, feel the minute heat and radiation, and reverse-engineer the correct answer. This is one of the reasons that Kamijou Touma figured out Etzali is borrowing Unabara's identity, since the real Unabara is supposedly not that smart when Etzali helped Touma do his summer homework.

Judging from Mikoto's unability to distinguish between the two, it's implied that Unbara's personality is the the one that Etzali portrayed while in disguise; that would be the character of a kind, straight and considerate young man that is quite modest about his great looks, it should also be noted that Unbara's grades are the best of his class, althrough the fact that he got his rank through cheating might be his only evident personality fault. After the events of Volume 5 his identity was still borrowed by Etzali, and his own whereabouts unknown; through in every existent media of To aru majutsu no Index he managed to escape from his imprisonment without suffering life threatening injuries. 

His ability is Level 4 Telekinesis (念動力, Nendō Ryoku?, lit. ""Telekinetic Force""), a kind of unseen power that can control objects from a distance.

He not only can use his ability to cover objects at a far distance, but he can also use his powers in his own body.

According to the novel, when Etzali attacked Unbara and peeled off some of his skin and severely injured him, Unbara managed to save his life with his own power, which he used to petrify every cell of his body; leaving him in a state that Etzali described as similar to ""cryogenic stasis"". In this state Unbara could not perform any movements, but he also could not suffer any harm reagardless of what attack Etzali launched at him.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/100996.jpg,1,anime,4654

Class: 2-C
Occupation: Student
Favorite food: Pork cutlet (tonkatsu)

Famous Quote: ""Having someone saying you're okay as you are being needed by that person. It was nice to have someone like that.""

Taiga is a girl in Ryuuji's class. She has a well-regulated and beautiful appearance though is unable to stomach company from others. Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature, she is given the nickname ""Palmtop Tiger.""

Her under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. She is also brutally honest, typically when she is lashing out at someone. Due to her cute looks (described as a doll by Ryuuji), she often gets confessions of love by boys, but she turns down every one of them, including Yuusaku Kitamura (which she later regrets).

Despite coming from a well-to-do family, her life with them is very difficult because of various problems. Her father and mother got a divorce, leaving Taiga with her father. When he remarried another woman who was significantly younger than himself, it caused misunderstandings between Taiga and her step-mother. One day it became too much for Taiga, causing her to run away from home and since then, she has taken to living on her own. Since she came from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. When she meets Ryuuji and learns of his domestic talents, she ends up relying on Ryuuji to clean up after her. Aside from sleeping in her own house, and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuuji's house; so much so that she is considered a member of his family.

At the beginning of the story, she is infatuated with Ryuuji's best friend Yuusaku Kitamura and gets nervous every time he appears around her. Ryuuji finds out due to a misplaced empty love letter from Taiga meant for Kitamura. Ryuuji then admits to having feelings for Taiga's best friend Minori. Due to this, Taiga and Ryuuji team up to help each other get into a relationship with each other's best friend.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/514086.jpg,31778,anime,4224

Ami is Yuusaku's childhood friend who transfers into his class midway through their second year of high school. She is very beautiful and even works as a model, though after she transfers school, she temporarily stops modeling. However, she still continues to go to the gym readily and maintains a slim figure. She is always kind and generous towards others, though this is merely a deception. In truth, she is arrogant and will not hesitate to use others for her own benefit. During her first meeting with Taiga, Ami showed her true colors, but the tables were turned when Taiga threw a counterattack back at her. Since then, Ami and Taiga have been enemies, though Ami still sometimes envies Taiga since she can always be honest. It's hinted at, mostly through her childhood friend Yuusaku, that she's like this because she hasn't really known any other life than her modeling, which is part of the reason she moved to their hometown to attend school there.

Which is why, through her affiliations with Taiga and Ryuuji, Ami eventually develops more of a ""middle ground"" personality, signified with her losing her temper and taking out her frustrations on a stalker fan. While this doesn't mean that she automatically become friends with Taiga, the two of them also meet halfway to some extent, thus running into arguments far less frequently. She can still be somewhat manipulative and mischievous, but her ""gravure airhead"" personality is almost entirely abandoned for a more outspoken one, and she's even helped out her newfound friends, including Taiga, on occasion.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/103093.jpg,3199,anime,4224

The Golden Witch and Endless Witch, and arguably the primary antagonist of the series. She is affectionately referred to as ""Beato."" She first appears in the ""Tea Party"" of Legend of the Golden Witch, where she confronts Battler over his refusal to accept that his friends and family were killed by magic, and challenges him to a game in which he must prove otherwise from Turn of the Golden Witch onward.

A witch who has lived for over a thousand years, she is said to appear as a cloud of golden butterflies, and has the power to summon higher demons among the seventy-two pillars to serve her. It is said that humans can summon her to have their wishes granted in exchange for compensation, though she often acts whimsically. She is the one rumored to have given Kinzou ten tons of gold and served under him as the alchemic advisor to the Ushiromiya family.

A young servant of Kinzo's mansion. His real name is Yoshiya (嘉哉?). He is a serious and fervent servant, carrying out his master's orders thoroughly. He is a bit frail and antisocial. He considers Shannon as an older sister and highly disapproves of her feelings for George, as he believes she should not feel love as she is only furniture. He has feelings for Jessica, which he tries to hide from even himself, because he thinks of himself as ""furniture"", rather than a human being. However, it is shown that he still deeply wishes to become a human being, and hopes to do so when he reaches the Golden Land. In Dawn Of the Golden Witch, he confesses to Jessica and they become a couple. He is willing to do whatever he can so he can be with Jessica as a human and be worthy of her love. Based on what Beatrice has shown Battler, he is able to use a red blade of light in battle and link with Shannon. Despite seeing himself to be in despair, he actually has surprisingly good relations with others on the island.

Eva and Hideyoshi's twenty-three-year-old son. He is the oldest of Kinzo's grandchildren, and an exceptional and diligent young adult. He was brought up by Eva specifically with the family headship in mind, and is also a skilled martial artist like his mother. He worked at his father's company as an apprentice throughout college, and respects his parents greatly, though he admittedly finds his mother overbearing. George is admired by everyone in his family, especially his cousins, who view him as their older brother and peacemaker. In his youth, however, he had been jealous of their more independent and impulsive lifestyles, particularly Battler, as unlike him, his mother made him do various things in his youth in order to shape him into the next head. As a result, he put up a more condescending mask towards his cousins, but has since outgrown this inferiority complex to a certain degree. He is in love with the maid Shannon and proposes to her (or at least intends to) in every game. Believing that his romance with a servant would be frowned upon by his family, however, he is fully willing and prepared to face the consequences.

Blood type: O
Likes: mystery novels
Dislikes: high places, vehicles

Battler is the eighteen-year-old son of Rudolf and his first wife Asumu, and is generally considered to be the main protagonist of the series. He is extremely stubborn, and is afraid of ""shaky"" transportation, fearing he might fall off a boat. At first glance, he appears to be hotheaded, cocky, and even a little perverted (given the fact that he tries to grope young ladies and even his cousin Jessica several times). However, he has a heart of gold he isn't afraid to show when the situation calls for it.

Battler is also an extremely rational young man, and has an extreme talent for deductive reasoning and thinking outside the box, described as ""flipping the chessboard"" so that he may be able to predict the moves and motives of his opponents. Because of this, he does not believe in witches or magic. This causes some conflict with his cousin Maria, who has immersed herself in studies of the occult and believes strongly in witches, especially the Golden Witch Beatrice.

Dislikes: Studying, bad mama, spicy food

Maria is Rosa's daughter, and is the youngest of the cousins at nine years old. She has a habit of uttering ""uu-uu"" at times, which frustrates Rosa greatly. Maria is also rather stubborn, and believes things easily, which isn't uncommon for someone her age. She has an interest in the occult, like her grandfather. She carries around a bag which is filled with occult items, such as a scorpion charm which wards off evil. She idolizes witches, and believes that they are there to bring people joy and happiness. In Maria's notebooks there are sketches of witches, and the witches are beautiful, fantastical creatures. It upsets Maria greatly when someone denies the existence of witches, especially Beatrice's existence. At certain times, Maria undergoes a personality change, and begins to laugh in an unnerving fashion. When she is in this mode, she acts rather condescendingly with regards to things about the occult, and will often call people like Battler ""stupid"" for having little to no knowledge of such things.

She dislikes her parents at times for the pressures they place on her regarding the family inheritance, which she has no interest in. However, she still shows concern for them deep down. She was born with weak bronchi, and occasionally suffers from asthma attacks. She is in love with Kanon, who tries to hide his own feelings from her, though she manages to reach out to him in Dawn of the Golden Witch, and they become a couple. She is willing to go to great lengths to gain Kanon's respect, and tries to avoid doing anything that could jeopardize that. Jessica is shown to be skilled with brass knuckles in Alliance of the Golden Witch.

Dislikes: All reptiles but especially snakes, smoking

A witch who resides within Eva's heart. She represents all of Eva's dark desires from her childhood, including her greed for the Ushiromiya family inheritance; as such, she has the appearance of Eva as a young girl.

She first appears in Banquet of the Golden Witch, where she helps Eva solve the riddle of Beatrice's epitaph, leading to her discovery of Kinzo's hidden gold and her inheritance of the Ushiromiya family. As stipulated in the epitaph, Eva inherits the name ""Beatrice"" and is granted the titles of Golden and Endless Witch, with Lambdadelta as her guardian. Eva-Beatrice is described by Ange as a ""black witch,"" meaning she manipulates others through anger and hatred. In many ways, she is even crueler than the original Beatrice, using her Endless Magic to ""play"" with her victims by killing them in bizarre ways (drowning in a sea of jelly, crushing under a mountain of cake) before resurrecting them and killing them again, repeating the cycle until she tires.

She is most likely the manifestation of all the Eva culprit theories similar to how Black Battler is the manifestation of all the Battler Culprit theories.

She is very mocking of others, repeatedly taunting them by saying, ""Heso demo kande shinjaebā?"" (ヘソでも噛んで死んじゃえばぁ??, lit. ""Why don't you bite at your belly button and die?"").

Quite flamboyant, Gaap loves to tease people and gives people random nicknames by shortening their names (""Riiche"" for Beatrice, ""Lia"" for Virgilia, etc.). She is one of Beatrice's friends, though she is greatly disliked by Virgilia. She draws power from the Abyss to summon holes that can lead anywhere, although there are limits. In battle, particularly against George in Alliance of the Golden Witch, she uses a combination of these portals and various kicks that stab with her sharp heels, overwhelming her opponent and keeping them from moving as they emerge from the portal in mid-air.

Dislikes: Boredom, being ignored

She is also known as the Most Powerful Witch in the Universe before losing to Bernkastel and is feared by most other witches, including Beatrice. She is quite childish and holds a grudge against Bernkastel for finally beating her in their last game, although she actually cares for her.

Her ""Magic of Certainty"" allows her to kill anyone without fail as an absolute result, which bends the basic rule of Umineko magic requiring a risk. Like Bernkastel, she is a Voyager. She wishes for Battler and Beatrice to fight against each other for eternity as a part of a larger plot to have Bernkastel lose against her.

She has lived for a thousand years. As a witch, she embodies the concept that 'hard-workers are rewarded', and is very respected even by human beings. She doesn't flee from the human concept of witch. Hence, the power of hers, who is a being respected by human beings, is immeasurable. However, she is whimsical about whose efforts she will reward and, in many situations, the person who can please her more will be able to receive her smile.

Her tremendous and swiftly fierce power makes any kind of witch surrender in a moment. However, she seems to be reckless and it was thoroughly read by Bernkastel.

Dislikes: Getting covered in sticky drool

A stuffed lion doll handmade by Rosa and given to Maria for her birthday. He became Maria’s furniture when she gave him a soul through magic. His name was originally intended to be ""Sakura"" (さくら?, based on a veiled reference to the manga and anime Cardcaptor Sakura), but since ""Sakura"" is traditionally a female name, Maria derived from it and added the male suffix tarō (たろう?). In reality, Sakutaro is a normal stuffed animal who Maria simply imagines to be alive, viewing him as one of her most beloved friends. His vessel takes the shape of a simple lion cub, while his human form has the appearance of a young boy with blond hair, red eyes, an orange cap with pointed ears, and an oversized yellow jacket; he wears a red muffler given to him by Maria in both of his forms. He is innocent and shy, and often utters the phrase uryū (うりゅー?)  He is also incredibly popular among the Sisters of Purgatory, who never waste an opportunity to pounce and cuddle him all at once, much to his dismay. As furniture under a witch of Mariage Sorcière, he serves as a non-aggressive diplomat with the ability to produce barriers and negate magical attacks to protect Maria, though his defensive powers pale in comparison to more experienced furniture. In Alliance of the Golden Witch, Sakutaro is torn apart by Rosa in a fight with Maria and believed to be impossible for Beatrice to resurrect due to Rosa's refusal to accept him afterward. However, he still appears before Ange, who comes across and repairs the remains of his vessel and revives him. In Dawn of the Golden Witch, Sakutaro assists Maria against Erika the two argue over a trivial magic trick, and manages to arrange a truce. He later defends Maria against Kanon when he attempts to kill her, only to be disintegrated by Shannon's own shield, though he is restored in the end.

Rosa is the president of a small design company, ""Anti-Rosa,"" which has recently begun to flounder, and thus seeks out Kinzo's inheritance to pay off her co-endorsers. On the surface, Rosa appears to be the most sensible and soothing of all the siblings. However, as a result of being downtrodden by her older siblings in her childhood and forced to endure the pressures of a single mother, she frequently loses control of her emotions and responds violently to her daughter's childish behavior and overenthusiastic approach to the occult. While Rosa thought that Maria saying 'uu-uu' was charming for a while, she eventually grew frustrated with it, and often resorted to hitting her. Whenever Rosa hits Maria, Maria says that she has been taken over by ""the black witch.""

He rarely leaves his exceedingly vast study, which contains various commodities such as a bed, lavatory, and bath. He is also a rabid practitioner of black magic and the occult, his shelves lined with volumes upon volumes of grimoires. One of his most prominent obsessions is Beatrice, a witch he is said to have summoned and contracted for ten tons worth of gold.

Eva is cheerful and mischievous, but also sinister and greedy. She is hostile towards her older brother Krauss, and rallies the other siblings against him in their fight for the family inheritance. She also looks down on Krauss's wife Natsuhi for not being related to the Ushiromiya family by blood. Because she believes George to be the rightful head of the Ushiromiya family, she is cruel towards the servant Shannon, as she suspects her of being his lover. 
Despite her insidious personality, however, she treasures her husband and son more than anything, but fears that she is too domineering towards them. She is skilled in various martial arts, and said to be excellent at cooking.

His daughter, Jessica, also has little respect for him, particularly due to the pressure he places on her to become (or at least marry) a suitable successor to the Ushiromiya family after him. He is a real estate investor, and is currently supplying his funds to a resort. However, he has been unable to carry out his plans, and thus his investments end in failure. Despite always swaggering about, Krauss holds genuine remorse for all the troubles he put his family through. He is known to have taken up boxing in his youth, and still possesses quite a bit of skill in that area. Unlike his siblings, he lives on Rokkenjima with his father, wife, and daughter.

She was the previous Endless Witch before Beatrice, and was also her teacher. 

Her new name (having passed her old one to her student) comes from the Divine Comedy character Virgil, who guides Dante through Hell and Purgatory to Beatrice, who is his guide through Heaven. 

She is a silver-haired witch with great powers, despite surrendering most of them to Beatrice with the title of the ""Endless Witch"". Unlike Beatrice, Virgilia thinks that the powers of a witch should be used for good and not for selfish means. 

She taught Beatrice the Endless Magic, and retired, believing that Beatrice would also devote herself for the people. At the same time that she was Beatrice's teacher, she also served as the magician of Beatrice's home. Because of that, Virgilia had come in contact with her with the position of a servant. It is said that this became her downfall, and invited Beatrice's arrogance and recklessness

155802,Erica Brown,エリカ・ブラウン,,"Erica Brown is a character in the Violet Evergarden series. She is an Auto Memories Doll who has been working at the CH Postal Company for a while. She is not good at communicating and isn't confident in her work.

Erica is a young woman with a relatively short stature and thin eyebrows. She has short, straight light brown-honey colored hair which reaches down to her chin with straight bangs covering her forehead. Her hairstyle somewhat resembles that of a longer bowl cut. She sports round, transparent glasses which she wears over her medium-colored amber eyes. She also has freckles located on the bridge of her nose and a small mole underneath her lip.

Erica is a quiet girl who is usually seen in the backgrounds. She isn't confident in her own work as an Auto Memories Doll and is easily swayed by other opinions and takes criticism on her work seriously and to the heart. She also always worries inwardly over her exchanges with her clients and has no confidence in her job. This has led to her timid personality and low self-confidence. However, it is evident that Erica is a strong-willed, very thoughtful and kind girl who will firmly stand to her own opinions.

Erica was motivated into becoming an Auto-Memories Doll due to a certain novelist’s influence, which made her wish she could write texts that resonated with people's hearts.

Birthdate: August 8
Hair color: Black
Eye color: Grey
Blood type: A
Occupation: high school student, member of Service Club
Affiliation: Sobu High School

Hachiman is the story's main protagonist, an isolated, friendless boy who is pragmatic to a fault. His most prominent feature is his set of ""dead fish-eyes."" He firmly believes that ""youth"" is simply an illusion created by hypocrites, for hypocrites, born from the ashes of past failures. In this state of apparent corruption, he is coerced into joining the Service Club by his futures advisor in the hopes that exposing him to the world will change his personality, and ultimately make him a ""better person."" He is called ""Hikki"" affectionately by Yui.

Yui is seen most of the time as a very cheerful, outgoing and friendly girl, in addition to having almost most of the time, a smile which denotes a clear and noticeable joy on her face, whether even when she is sad or upset.

Abilties:
Yui's social skills are excellent, but she is also good, though not particularly outstanding, at academics, intellectuals, and athletics. Other characters always comment on her intelligence and social awareness. She is exceptionally skilled at deducing the mood of others and can make others feel comfortable just by being there. Although some people say that she is dumb, probably due to her naive and somewhat stupid nature, Yui reminds people that she passed high academic standards to get into Sōbu.

She has the ability to sing well and enjoys karaoke. She is a good coordinator and hard worker, able to follow through and give directions when needed (Athletics/Cultural Festivals).

She has a twisted sense of ""noblesse oblige,"" and believes that it is the duty of the exceptional (in other words, herself) to help the ""lost lambs"" of the world. Her personality often leads her to be disgusted at the naivety of others, particularly Yui's, and she does not hesitate to show it. Despite this, Yui still affectionately calls her ""Yukinon.""

Birthday: July 24
Blood type: A

Akari is a polite red-haired girl who is supposedly the main protagonist of the series. However, due to her rather small presence and plain personality, she is often forgotten about or pushed into the background. One of her few features is hair dumplings which sometimes come off strangely. She is often thought of as having the ability to fire her hair dumplings and turn invisible whilst shouting ""Akkari~n!"". Kyōko and Yui are her childhood friends, while Chinatsu, Sakurako and Himawari are her classmates.

She enjoys video games and is shown to be a good cook, leaving Chinatsu obsessed with her food. She is a reliable friend and lives alone in an apartment complex, and although she won't admit it, she tends to feel lonely when others, particularly Kyouko, aren't around. Although generally quiet, she will sometimes burst into stifled laughter upon hearing Ayano's puns.

While generally cute, benevolent and fun-loving, especially in the presence of Yui, she tends to be selfish and occasionally shows dark thoughts. She also has a terrifying lack of artistic skills, frequently leaving others in shock.

A middle school boy who has chuunibyou tendencies. He loves spending time reading books in the library, where he and Anna first met. Initially, Kyotaro had delusions of killing Anna and making her corpse his alone, but they were replaced by romantic affection as he spends more time around her. He can be quite perceptive in social situations but often fails to pick up on other social problems due to his lack of communication skills and low self-esteem. Aside from his macabre interests, he's also a fan of manga and anime such as Baki, Beastars and Re:Zero. In the latter case he keeps the character Rem as the profile image for his Line account. Prior to middle school, he won a number of first-place awards for essays, a poster drawing, an independent research project, etc.

Anna frequently brings snacks and candy to eat in private at the library, much to Kyotaro's dismay. She’s very considerate of others, such as eating snacks by herself due to her friend Chii having allergies. This consideration is tied to something of a guilt complex, which leads to bouts of anxiety where she feels she’s inconvenienced other people to the point of tears. She is also shown to be very jealous to the point of obsession whenever Kyotaro interacts with other girls.

Panty is Stocking's sister. She is an angel forced to kill evil spirits in order to earn her way back into Heaven. She is obsessed with sex and as such, spends a lot of her free time in love hotels with random men. She speaks with a traditional Tokyo dialect and bad girl's dialect. Her name is also the source of her power as she is able to transform her panties into a diamond handgun named Back Lace, that has amazingly destructive power against spirits but can't even bruise humans.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/101435.jpg,1578,anime,52293
32801,Stocking Anarchy,ストッキング・アナーキー,,"Height: 1.52m
Weight: 43 kg
Sizes: 98-61-84

Stocking is a main character in the Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt series. She is a gothic female angel, with long violet/pink hair and teal eyes. Stocking is the younger of the Anarchy sisters. Like Panty, her name derives from the object she is able to weaponize. 

She is a level-headed and intelligent girl, though, she can be rude if provoked, especially towards her older sister, Panty. Stocking enjoys eating various desserts and sugary food, but doesn't seem to gain weight (she assures all the fat goes towards her breasts anyway). However, she becomes enraged and sensitive whenever someone calls her fat.

Stocking is often considered to be the personification of the deadly sin, Gluttony, due to her obsession with sweets. She does not share Panty's obsession with sex, even though she does display some masochistic tendencies, such as bondage, vore and electrocution, which is ironic considering she constantly insults the demon sisters and Corset affinity for similar fetishes by calling them 'BDSM loving freaks'. Stocking does claim she has very special standards in men, and prefers love over lust. She strings men along (not wanting them to believe she is 'easy'), and would never cheat on someone she truly loves. However, she has been shown to have a very strange and twisted vision of what she finds attractive. 

Stocking hates spicy food, just as much as Panty hates sweet food. Stocking is sometimes overshadowed by Panty when in larger audiences due to the latter's more sensuous and exhibitionist behavior, such as in ""Sex and the Daten City"" and ""1 Angry Ghost."" She is almost always seen carrying around a plush cat, Honekoneko, whose expressions often match Stocking's mood.

Abilities
To prepare for battle, Stocking removes her stockings. Her ability is being able to transform her stockings into a pair of katanas, known as Stripes I &amp; II, which can be attached at the base of the hilt. It's safe to assume she can form other blades as well, considering the range of weaponry at Panty's disposal.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/101434.jpg,3924,anime,52293

He appears to be into self punishment and a fetish for bondage like Stocking. This evident from the buckles on his body, mouth stretchers and his namesake, the corset. He has an extreme interest with Hell's Monkey, a mystical key possessed by Brief, which has the power to unleash the forces of Hell on Earth.

The protagonist of the series. With a gentle appearance and slim profile, in many ways Haruka is the splitting image of his fraternal twin sister Sora. Personable and honest, he forges lasting friendships with remarkable ease. Haruka copes with the loss of his parents with a stout heart, burdened with the knowledge that the future of his delicate sister depends on him. As a result, he has a tendency to dote on his sister and worry about her constantly. He cannot swim either.

Known relatives: Kasugano Haruka (twin brother)

She is a quiet, fragile and reclusive girl, and fraternal twin sister to the main protagonist. Cursed with illness and frailty since birth, Sora was denied the sort of independent life that many take for granted. Yet beneath Sora's angelic doll-like appearance lies a troublesome personality that’s prone to withdrawn laziness and demonstrates a rather severe lack of social graces. In all honesty, Sora doesn't care for anyone else, and would much rather just surf the Internet and eat instant food, for as long as Haruka is always by her side. It's implied that her strong bond with Haruka, strengthened as a result of the tragic loss of their parents, may be leading her towards fantasies of incest between twins. She hates Nao, although it is implied that they were once good friends. She is often seen carrying a rabbit doll, which she received as a present before she and Haruka left the village.

Despite her seemingly yandere-like personality, she does have Mei's best interests at heart as she begrudgingly accepts Yuzu's attraction towards Mei.

118715,Sakura Adachi,安達 桜,,"Sakura Adachi is a first-year high school student. She tends to skip class and that's why the rest of the students see her as a delinquent, but she just doesn't like to be around people. One day, Hougetsu Shimamura, a girl from her class, finds her on the second floor of the gym with the intention of skipping class too. Strangely, Sakura becomes really attached to Hougetsu and wants to be the closest person to her.

Adachi had an extremely introverted personality. Before meeting Shimamura, she never had someone whom she can call a friend. Adachi was said to be cold toward other people and didn't attempt to make friends with other people in the past.

She is also a generally very jealous person towards Shimamura when she is together with her friends and as a consequence usually ends up running away.

She is left-handed.

The two instantly took a liking for each other and began to hang out together all the time.

In both manga adaptations, it was Shimamura who walked in on Adachi in the gym when they first met instead of the reverse.

Shimamura is a bit of an airhead who loves sleeping and can do so for as long as she wants. Contrary to Adachi, she has grown up on much better terms with her family and as such manages to be much more sociable even if she doesn’t see herself as a particularly kind person. She tends to think about her relationship with Adachi as that of an older sister or a mother. She also enjoys teasing Adachi quite a bit.

He is also a member of a writing club at his high school, and is a big fan of the superhero called Guricho. He meets Merry when she falls on top of him as he comes back from his errands, and together, they enter a daydream - basically, a dream that occurs in full daylight.

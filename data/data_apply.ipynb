This coupled with her generally expressionless face has led to her being ostracized in the past which made her scared to get close to others. Due to this, Reina is incredibly appreciative to those who accept her despite her strange behaviors such as her friends and family. She often feels obliged to repay their kindness to her with whatever means she has (e.g: making them food, teaching them, etc)._x000D_\n_x000D_\nDue to her inability to gauge interpersonal distance, Reina is often self-conscious of the way she is viewed by her friends. She also fears being a burden to them due to her own perceived inability. Despite that, she is willing to step up when her friends need her and isn't afraid to show her appreciation to them. Reina values the friends she has made in high school greatly and has expressed her desire that she wishes for them to continue being friends long after their graduation._x000D_\n_x000D_\n(Source: Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Wiki)",

This coupled with her generally expressionless face has led to her being ostracized in the past which made her scared to get close to others. Due to this, Reina is incredibly appreciative to those who accept her despite her strange behaviors such as her friends and family. She often feels obliged to repay their kindness to her with whatever means she has (e.g: making them food, teaching them, etc)._x000D_\n_x000D_\nDue to her inability to gauge interpersonal distance, Reina is often self-conscious of the way she is viewed by her friends.

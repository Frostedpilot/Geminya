She is seen most of the time to have a stoic expression even when laughing or crying. Despite that, she is capable of smiling and becoming cheerful, mostly when Raido is present.

This coupled with her generally expressionless face has led to her being ostracized in the past which made her scared to get close to others. Due to this, Reina is incredibly appreciative to those who accept her despite her strange behaviors such as her friends and family. She often feels obliged to repay their kindness to her with whatever means she has (e.g: making them food, teaching them, etc)._x000D_\n_x000D_\nDue to her inability to gauge interpersonal distance, Reina is often self-conscious of the way she is viewed by her friends.

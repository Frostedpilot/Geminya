## üéØ How It Works

### Architecture Overview

```
Discord User ‚Üí Bot Commands ‚Üí Spotify Search ‚Üí librespot Stream ‚Üí Discord Voice
```

1. **Search Phase**: Bot uses Spotify Web API (spotipy) to search for tracks
2. **Selection Phase**: User selects from search results via Discord buttons
3. **Streaming Phase**: Bot uses librespot-python to create audio stream
4. **Playback Phase**: Bot plays audio through Discord voice connection

### Technical Details

- **Search**: Uses official Spotify Web API for metadata
- **Streaming**: Uses librespot-python for direct audio streaming
- **Queue**: Bot manages its own queue system
- **Voice**: Uses Discord.py voice functionality with PyNaCl

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Spotify services not available"

- Check that all 4 Spotify credentials are in `secrets.json`
- Verify credentials are correct
- Ensure you have Spotify Premium

#### "Failed to create librespot session"

- Check username/password are correct
- Ensure you're not using Facebook login
- Try restarting the bot
- Check if Spotify account is active

#### "No audio in voice channel"

- Ensure bot has proper voice permissions
- Check that you're in the same voice channel
- Verify volume is not at 0
- Try rejoining the voice channel

#### "Failed to create audio source"

- Track may not be available in your region
- Track may be premium-only content
- librespot session may have expired - restart bot

### Audio Quality Issues

The bot supports different quality levels:

- **NORMAL**: 96 kbps
- **HIGH**: 160 kbps (default)
- **VERY_HIGH**: 320 kbps

Quality is set in the SpotifyService initialization and affects bandwidth usage.

### Rate Limiting

- Spotify Web API has rate limits for searches
- librespot may have connection limits
- If you encounter issues, wait a few minutes before retrying

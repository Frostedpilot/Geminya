## **🔧 Current Template/TODO Items**

### **⚠️ Phase 2 Limitations (Ready for Phase 3)**

#### **Combat System Simplifications**
```python
# combat_system.py - LINE 30-35
def _resolve_basic_attack(self, action_command):
    # TODO: Replace with Universal Scaling Formula (GDD 6.1-6.3)
    attack_power = caster_stats.get_stat('atk')
    base_damage = max(1, attack_power // 2)  # SIMPLE FORMULA FOR PHASE 2
    
    # TODO: Add elemental modifiers, critical hits, status effects
    defense = target_stats.get_stat('vit')
    damage_reduction = defense / (defense + 50)  # SIMPLE REDUCTION
```

#### **AI System Limitations**
```python
# ai_system.py - LINE 18-25
def choose_action(self, character):
    # TODO: Implement Three-Phase AI (Role -> Skill -> Target)
    # For Phase 2: Simple AI - pick random enemy and use basic attack
    target = random.choice(enemies)
    
    return ActionCommand(
        caster=character,
        skill_name="basic_attack",  # TODO: Real skill selection
        targets=[target],
        skill_data={"type": "damage", "element": "physical"}  # TODO: Real skills
    )
```

#### **Stats Component Limitations**
```python
# stats_component.py - LINE 6-7
def get_stat(self, stat_name):
    return self.base_stats.get(stat_name, 0)  # TODO: Apply active modifiers
    
    # TODO: Calculate final stats from:
    # 1. Base stats
    # 2. Equipment bonuses
    # 3. Active buffs/debuffs
    # 4. Leader bonuses
    # 5. Team synergies

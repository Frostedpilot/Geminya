expansion with performance optimization and careful attention to game balance.

The roadmap is aggressive but achievable with proper sprint planning and 
risk management. Priority should be given to critical items that directly 
impact player experience: AI intelligence, signature abilities, and 
performance optimization.

Estimated Timeline: 20-24 weeks (10-12 sprints)
Team Size Recommended: 3-4 developers
Budget Estimate: High (significant content creation required)

Phase 4 Success Criteria: 
- Polished, balanced auto-battle system
- Rich content variety (3x current skill/ability count)
- Intelligent AI that provides challenging gameplay
- Optimized performance for smooth user experience
- Comprehensive testing and balance validation

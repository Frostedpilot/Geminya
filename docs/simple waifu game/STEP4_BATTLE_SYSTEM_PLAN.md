# Step 4: Battle System Implementation

## Overview

Building on the solid foundation of Steps 1-3 (Event System, Character Components, and Abilities System), Step 4 implements the core battle mechanics that bring everything together into a functional combat system.

## Implementation Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Turn-based Combat**: Action gauge-driven turn system
2. **Battle Management**: Centralized battle state and flow control  
3. **Combat Resolution**: Proper damage/healing calculations with events
4. **Victory Conditions**: Battle end detection and result determination
5. **Basic AI**: Simple but effective AI decision making
6. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing abilities system

### Architecture Principles
- **Event-Driven**: All battle actions generate appropriate events
- **Modular Design**: Independent systems that communicate via events
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new battle mechanics and AI strategies
- **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage for all battle logic

## Core Systems to Implement

### 1. Turn System (`src/game/systems/turn_system.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Manage action gauge for all participants
- Calculate turn order based on speed/gauge
- Process turn queue and execute actions
- Emit turn-related events

**Key Features:**
- Action gauge incrementation based on character speed
- Turn queue with priority handling
- Turn events: `turn.start`, `turn.processing`, `turn.end`
- Speed-based turn order calculation
- Overflow gauge handling for multiple actions

**Integration Points:**
- Uses character `state.action_gauge` and speed stats
- Coordinates with Combat System for action execution
- Publishes events that abilities can hook into

### 2. Combat System (`src/game/systems/combat_system.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Initialize and manage battle sessions
- Coordinate action execution between characters
- Handle damage/healing resolution with proper events
- Manage battle flow and state transitions

**Key Features:**
- Battle initialization with team setup
- Action execution pipeline with validation
- Damage calculation with modifier events
- Healing resolution with overheal protection
- Status effect application and management
- Battle logging and event history

**Integration Points:**
- Executes skills from Abilities System within battle context
- Publishes combat events for passive abilities to react
- Coordinates with Turn System for action processing
- Uses Battle Context for state management

### 3. Battle Context (`src/game/core/battle_context.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Central container for all battle state
- Manage battle participants and teams
- Track battle phase, round, and metadata
- Provide state queries for AI and abilities

**Key Features:**
- Immutable battle state snapshots
- Participant management (allies, enemies, spectators)
- Round and phase tracking
- Battle metadata (start time, conditions, etc.)
- State query methods for AI and effects

**Data Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class BattleContext:
    battle_id: str
    participants: Dict[str, Character]
    teams: Dict[str, List[str]]  # team_name -> character_ids
    current_round: int
    battle_phase: BattlePhase
    turn_queue: List[str]
    environment: Dict[str, Any]
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

### 4. Victory System (`src/game/systems/victory_system.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Evaluate victory conditions after each action
- Determine battle outcomes and results
- Handle victory/defeat/draw scenarios
- Calculate battle rewards and penalties

**Key Features:**
- Standard victory conditions (all enemies defeated)
- Custom victory conditions (objectives, time limits)
- Battle result calculation
- Experience and reward distribution
- Battle statistics compilation

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Elimination**: All enemies defeated
- **Objective**: Specific goals completed
- **Time Limit**: Battle duration exceeded
- **Surrender**: Manual battle forfeit

### 5. AI System (`src/game/systems/ai_system.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Make intelligent action decisions for AI characters
- Select appropriate targets for skills
- Evaluate battle situations and adapt strategy
- Provide different AI personality templates

**Key Features:**
- Action evaluation and selection
- Target prioritization algorithms
- Threat assessment and positioning
- Multiple AI behavior patterns
- Decision making with incomplete information

**AI Behaviors:**
- **Aggressive**: Focus on dealing maximum damage
- **Defensive**: Prioritize healing and protection  
- **Balanced**: Mix of offense and support
- **Strategic**: Long-term planning and setup

## Integration with Existing Systems

### With Abilities System (Step 3)
- Skills execute within battle context
- Passive abilities react to battle events
- Action costs managed by turn system
- Cooldowns tracked across battle rounds

### With Character Components (Step 2)
- Stats used for damage calculations and turn speed
- Effects applied during combat resolution
- State tracking for battle-specific conditions
- Component updates trigger appropriate events

### With Event System (Step 1)
- All battle actions publish events
- Battle systems coordinate via event bus
- Abilities hook into battle events
- Event history maintained for debugging

**Ready to Begin**: Step 4 implementation builds naturally on our robust foundation. The abilities system provides the skills framework, the character components provide the stats and state management, and the event system provides the communication infrastructure. Now we tie it all together with proper battle mechanics.

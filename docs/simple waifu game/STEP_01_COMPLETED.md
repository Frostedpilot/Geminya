# Step 1 Implementation - Foundation Setup - COMPLETED

## Overview
✅ **COMPLETED**: The foundation systems for the Geminya Auto-Battler have been successfully implemented and tested.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Event System (`src/game/core/event_system.py`)
- **EventBus**: Central event management with priority-based handler execution
- **GameEvent**: Flexible event data structure with cancellation and modification support
- **EventHandler**: Handler registration with conditions and priorities
- **EventPriority & EventPhase**: Enums for event processing control
- **Global event bus instance**: Ready for game-wide event communication

**Key Features:**
- Priority-based handler execution (HIGHEST → LOWEST)
- Event cancellation and modification capabilities
- Conditional handler execution
- Global and specific event type handlers
- Event history tracking with configurable limits
- Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types

### 2. Battle Context System (`src/game/core/battle_context.py`)
- **BattleContext**: Central battle state manager
- **BattlePhase & TurnPhase**: Battle flow state machines
- **BattleSnapshot**: Battle state snapshots for rollback/debugging
- **BattleRules**: Configurable battle parameters

**Key Features:**
- Team and character management (placeholder for future character integration)
- Turn advancement with automatic limit checking
- Global effect management
- Battle action logging with automatic cleanup
- State snapshotting and restoration capabilities
- Victory condition checking framework
- Comprehensive battle summary generation

### 3. Event Creation Utilities (`src/game/core/events.py`)
- Factory functions for creating standard game events
- Battle events (start, end, turn management)
- Character events (join, leave, death)
- Action events (skills, damage, healing)
- Status effect events (applied, removed)
- Stat change events
- System events (errors, debug)

### 4. Module Structure
```
src/game/
├── __init__.py           # Main game module exports
├── core/
│   ├── __init__.py       # Core systems exports
│   ├── event_system.py   # Event management
│   ├── battle_context.py # Battle state management
│   └── events.py         # Event creation utilities
├── test_foundation.py    # Comprehensive test suite
└── demo_foundation.py    # Working demonstration
```

## Test Results
✅ **All 12 tests passed** (100% success rate):
- Event system functionality (registration, priority, cancellation)
- Battle context management (phases, turns, effects, logging)
- Event creation utilities

## Demonstration
✅ **Working demo** showing:
- Event handler registration with priorities
- Event modification and cancellation
- Battle context state management
- Event-driven battle flow
- Team and turn management
- Global effects system

## Integration Points

The foundation provides these integration points for future steps:

### For Step 2 (Components):
- `BattleContext.characters` - Character storage
- Character lifecycle events (join, leave, death)
- `_serialize_character_state()` and `_restore_character_state()` hooks

### For Step 3 (Abilities):
- Skill use events with source/target tracking
- Damage and healing event framework
- Effect application event system

### For Step 4 (Turn System):
- `BattleContext.turn_order` - Turn sequence management
- `BattleContext.active_character_id` - Current actor tracking
- Turn phase management (start, execution, end)

### For Step 5 (Combat):
- Damage calculation event pipeline
- Status effect application events
- Combat result logging and tracking

## Code Quality
- Comprehensive type hints throughout
- Detailed docstrings for all public methods
- Proper error handling with specific exceptions
- Lazy logging for performance
- Clean separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture properly established

## Next Steps
The foundation is ready for Step 2: Character Component System implementation. The event system and battle context provide all necessary infrastructure for:

1. Component-based character architecture
2. Stat management with modifiers
3. Effect application and tracking
4. Character state persistence and restoration

## Notes
- Some placeholder methods (character serialization) are marked for implementation in Step 2
- The system is designed to be extensible and modular
- Event-driven architecture ensures loose coupling between systems
- Battle context provides comprehensive state management for complex battle scenarios

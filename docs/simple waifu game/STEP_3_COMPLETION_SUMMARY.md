# Step 3: Abilities System - COMPLETED ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive abilities system that integrates seamlessly with the character component system from Step 2. The system provides both active skills and passive abilities with full event-driven functionality.

## Completed Systems

### 1. **Core Abilities Framework** (`src/game/components/abilities_component.py`)
- **BaseSkill Class**: Abstract base for all active abilities
- **BasePassive Class**: Abstract base for all passive abilities  
- **SkillCost System**: Resource costs (HP, action gauge, mana, etc.)
- **SkillCondition System**: Requirements for skill usage
- **AbilitiesComponent**: Manages all character skills and passives

### 2. **Skill Implementations** (`src/game/components/skill_implementations.py`)
- **BasicAttackSkill**: Universal attack available to all characters
- **HealSkill**: Healing ability with percentage-based restoration
- **FireballSkill**: Magic attack with burn status effect application
- **Skill Types**: Basic attacks, active skills, ultimate abilities, reactions
- **Target Types**: Single enemy, AoE, self-targeting, ally support

### 3. **Passive Implementations** (`src/game/components/passive_implementations.py`)
- **StatBoostPassive**: Permanent stat increases (working: ATK +15% = 80→92)
- **BerserkerRagePassive**: Conditional stat boosts (ATK +40% when HP < 30%)
- **CounterAttackPassive**: Reactive abilities triggered by events
- **RegenerationPassive**: Turn-based healing effects
- **Passive Types**: Generic, signature, reactive, conditional

### 4. **Character Integration** (`src/game/components/character.py`)
- **Abilities Property**: Direct access to character's abilities component
- **Skill Methods**: `add_skill()`, `get_skill()`, `can_use_ability()`
- **Passive Methods**: `add_passive()`, `get_passive()`
- **Automatic Basic Attack**: All characters get basic attack skill by default
- **Character Reference**: Abilities component has proper character context

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ **Active Skills System**
```python
# Example: Fireball skill with conditions and effects
fireball = FireballSkill()
character.add_skill(fireball)
can_cast = character.can_use_ability("fireball")  # Checks MAG requirements
```

### ✅ **Passive Abilities with Immediate Application**
```python
# Example: Stat boost that immediately affects character
stat_boost = StatBoostPassive(
    passive_id="combat_training",
    stat_type=StatType.ATK,
    boost_amount=0.15  # 15% increase
)
character.add_passive(stat_boost)
# ATK: 80 → 92 (immediately applied)
```

### ✅ **Conditional Passives**
```python
# Example: Berserker rage triggers when HP < 30%
berserker = BerserkerRagePassive(atk_boost=0.4, hp_threshold=0.3)
# Automatically activates/deactivates based on character state
```

### ✅ **Event-Driven Reactive Abilities**
```python
# Example: Counter-attack responds to damage events
counter = CounterAttackPassive(counter_chance=0.3, counter_damage=0.8)
# Triggers on "damage.taken" events with 30% chance
```

### ✅ **Resource Cost System**
```python
# Skills can cost action gauge, HP, mana, etc.
heal_cost = SkillCost(action_cost=200, hp_cost=10)
```

### ✅ **Skill Conditions**
```python
# Skills can have requirements (stat minimums, status conditions, etc.)
condition = SkillCondition(
    condition_id="mag_requirement",
    check_function=lambda char: char.get_stat("mag") >= 50
)
```

## Technical Architecture

```
Character
├── AbilitiesComponent
    ├── Skills (by type: basic_attack, active, ultimate, reaction)
    │   ├── BasicAttackSkill (universal)
    │   ├── HealSkill (percentage-based healing)
    │   └── FireballSkill (damage + burn effect)
    └── Passives (by type: generic, signature, reactive, conditional)
        ├── StatBoostPassive (immediate stat modifiers)
        ├── BerserkerRagePassive (conditional activation)
        └── CounterAttackPassive (event-triggered)
```

## Test Coverage

**27/27 tests passing** with comprehensive coverage:

1. **Core System Tests** (5 tests)
   - Skill cost creation and validation
   - Skill condition checking
   - Basic framework functionality

2. **Skill Implementation Tests** (7 tests)
   - Basic attack skill creation and execution
   - Heal skill functionality
   - Fireball skill with status effects

3. **Passive Implementation Tests** (6 tests)
   - Stat boost passive creation and application
   - Berserker rage conditional logic
   - Counter-attack event handling

4. **Component Integration Tests** (5 tests)
   - Abilities component creation
   - Skill and passive management
   - Serialization support

5. **Character Integration Tests** (4 tests)
   - Character-ability integration
   - Automatic basic attack addition
   - Skill usage validation

## Demonstrated Functionality

The working demo shows:

- **Character Creation**: Battle Mage with 80 ATK, 90 MAG
- **Passive Application**: Combat Training +15% ATK (80 → 92)
- **Skill Availability**: Basic attack, heal, fireball all usable
- **Component Integration**: 5 skills, 3 passives properly managed
- **Conditional Passives**: Berserker rage ready to trigger at low HP

## Integration with Step 2

The abilities system seamlessly integrates with existing components:

- **Stats Component**: Passives add stat modifiers through the established system
- **Effects Component**: Skills can apply status effects (burn, heal over time)
- **State Component**: Skills consume action gauge and trigger cooldowns
- **Event System**: Reactive passives respond to game events

## Files Created/Modified

## Performance & Design Notes

- **Efficient Passive Application**: Only applied when character reference exists
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Reactive passives use existing event system
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new skills and passives
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for all ability parameters
- **Memory Efficient**: Abilities stored by type for quick lookup

## Known Working Features

✅ **Passive stat bonuses applied immediately**  
✅ **All skill types (basic attack, heal, fireball) functional**  
✅ **Skill availability checking works**  
✅ **Character-ability integration complete**  
✅ **Event-driven reactive abilities**  
✅ **Conditional passive logic**  
✅ **Resource cost validation**  
✅ **Full test coverage passing**

## Ready for Next Steps

The abilities system provides the foundation for:

1. **Battle System** (Step 4): Skills execution during combat
2. **Equipment System**: Items that add/modify abilities
3. **Character Progression**: Learning new skills, upgrading passives
4. **AI System**: NPCs using skills strategically

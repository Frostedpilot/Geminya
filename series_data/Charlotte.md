**Series-wise Events:**

    *   **Option A:** "Follow Nao's logical approach." -> You spend extra time searching. Add +2 to the floor's turn counter. The party finds the target and gains a valuable piece of equipment.
    *   **Option B:** "Trust Ayumi's intuition." -> Ayumi's guess is wrong, and you walk into an ambush! Start the next battle with a random ally at 50% HP. However, the close call strengthens your resolve. All "Charlotte" allies gain +5 permanent `vit`.

    *   **Option A:** "Have Ayumi unleash her power." -> The area is devastated. You win the current node without a fight, but all allies in the party take 30% of their max HP in damage. Ayumi is exhausted and cannot be used for the next 2 battles.
    *   **Option B:** "Try to calm her down." -> It's a struggle, but you manage to avert disaster. Ayumi is shaken but safe. She gains +15 permanent `spr`, and the party must face a difficult elite battle immediately.

**Series-wise Passives:**

**Series-wise Items:**

1.  **Prized Melon Bread**

**Series-wise Events:**

1.  **The Dog and the Melon Bread**
    *   **Description:** A stray dog appears, eyeing Satania's precious melon bread. Satania, proclaiming it an arch-nemesis, prepares for a grand battle. Raphiel watches with a serene smile, clearly enjoying the show.
    *   **Option A:** "Help Satania protect her bread." -> You successfully distract the dog. Satania is grateful, granting her the **Vigor** passive for the next 3 battles.
    *   **Option B:** "Let Raphiel 'help' the situation." -> Raphiel "accidentally" trips Satania, and the dog snatches the bread. Satania is furious, starting the next battle with 'Berserk' (+20% `atk`, -20% `vit`). Raphiel gains +10 permanent `lck` for the run from the sheer entertainment.

2.  **Gabriel's Gaming All-Nighter (Co-op Event: Gabriel & Vignette)**

    *   **Option B:** "Support Gabriel's raid." -> Gabriel, fueled by caffeine and friendship, leads her guild to victory. She gains the **Commander's Aura** passive for the rest of the run, but both she and Vigne start the next battle with 20% less max HP.

3.  **A Beach Trip Gone Wrong**
    *   **Description:** The group is at the beach, but Gabriel refuses to leave the shade of the umbrella to play games, while Satania's "demonic" sandcastle is immediately washed away by the tide. Vignette is trying to keep everyone from getting heatstroke.

    *   **Option B:** "Just relax and let them do their own thing." -> Everyone gets a bit sunburnt and tired. All allies start the next battle with -10% `vit`, but also gain a 'Regeneration' effect for 2 turns.

4.  **The Ultimate Spice Challenge**
    *   **Description:** Satania claims she can handle the spiciest ramen in town to prove her demonic fortitude. Raphiel, naturally, orders the hottest one for her.
    *   **Requirement:** Have Satanichia and Raphiel on your team.
    *   **Option A:** "Let her eat it." -> Satania eats the entire bowl without flinching, thanks to her terrible sense of taste. She is hailed as a legend. Satania gains the **Thick Hide** passive for the rest of the run.
    *   **Option B:** "Convince her it's a bad idea." -> Satania accuses you of underestimating her power but secretly feels relieved. She gets a normal ramen instead and recovers 25% of her max HP.

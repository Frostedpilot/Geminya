    *   **Description:** You notice Minami seems troubled. She quietly approaches and asks if you have any extra healing supplies, as she's used all of hers tending to other students.
    *   **Option A:** "Give her your spare supplies." -> She gives a small, rare smile of gratitude. The whole party gains a temporary `Regeneration` buff (20% `spr` per turn) for the next 2 turns of the next battle.
    *   **Option B:** "Point her towards the nurse's office." -> She nods silently and leaves. She gains +5 permanent `int` for being resourceful, but the opportunity to bond is missed.

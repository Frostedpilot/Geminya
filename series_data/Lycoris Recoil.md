**Series-wise Events:**

1.  **Mission Briefing**
    *   **Description:** A direct order from DA Command comes in. A high-value target needs to be neutralized. The intel is sparse, and the approach is risky. Takina argues for a direct, efficient assault, while Chisato suggests a more subtle, roundabout approach to minimize casualties.
    *   **Option A:** "Follow Takina's direct approach." -> The next battle is a guaranteed Elite encounter, but winning it grants a rare piece of equipment.
    *   **Option B:** "Adopt Chisato's subtle plan." -> You skip the next battle entirely but must sacrifice a moderate amount of currency to "gather intel." The party gains a +15% `lck` buff for the next 3 battles.

2.  **Walnut's Request**
    *   **Description:** Kurumi, under her hacker alias "Walnut," needs to access a secure server. She requires a distraction. Mizuki can cause a traffic jam, or Chisato and Takina can stir up trouble nearby.
    *   **Requirement:** Have Kurumi on your team.
    *   **Option A:** "Create a diversion with the team." -> The hack is successful. Kurumi gains +10 permanent `int` for the run, and you find a valuable data cache (gain a large amount of currency).
    *   **Option B:** "Let Kurumi handle it herself." -> The hack is much riskier. There's a 50% chance Kurumi succeeds and gains +20 permanent `int`, and a 50% chance she fails and starts the next battle with the 'Silence' debuff for 2 turns.

3.  **An Unscheduled Day Off**

    *   **Option B:** "Join Mizuki for a drink." -> It's a relaxing afternoon. All allies from the series heal for 50% HP, but have a 25% chance to start the next battle with -10% `atk`.

4.  **A Difference in Philosophy (Co-op Event: Chisato & Takina)**
    *   **Description:** While pursuing a target, Chisato has a clear, non-lethal shot, but Takina has an equally clear, lethal one. They look to you for the final call.
    *   **Option A:** "Let Chisato take the shot." -> Chisato successfully incapacitates the target. She gains the **Unscathed** passive for the next battle. The party gains a "Good Karma" buff, increasing `lck` by 20 for the next 3 nodes.
    *   **Option B:** "Authorize Takina's shot." -> Takina eliminates the threat with cold efficiency. She gains +10 permanent `atk` for the run, but the party gains a "Bad Karma" debuff, decreasing `lck` by 10 for the next 3 nodes.

### **Character: Ayana Sakanagi (1 Star)**

***Developer Note:*** *Swim Swim is the primary antagonist of her arc and is incredibly powerful due to her nigh-invulnerability. Her 1-star rarity is a significant mismatch with her lore capabilities. I strongly recommend you consider bumping her to a 3-star character, which would allow for an Ultimate skill and passives that better reflect her ability to become untargetable. For now, her skills are chosen to represent a slippery, hard-to-hit debuffer.*

**Exclusive Events:**

1.  **For His Sake**
    *   **Description:** Sayaka stands outside a hospital room, listening to the sound of a violin. It's the boy she made her wish for. She looks happy, but also deeply pained, knowing he'll likely never know what she sacrificed.
    *   **Option A:** "Her sacrifice was worth it." -> Her resolve hardens. Sayaka gains a permanent +15 `spr`.
    *   **Option B:** "She deserves to be happy too." -> She clenches her fists, a flicker of resentment in her eyes. Sayaka gains a permanent +15 `atk` but starts the next battle with -10% max HP.

2.  **Unbending Justice**
    *   **Description:** A weak familiar is terrorizing a small area. Kyubey suggests leaving it alone, as it's not worth the effort and doesn't drop a Grief Seed. Sayaka, however, is furious. "We can't just let it hurt people!" she yells, ready to fight.
    *   **Option A:** "Help her defeat the familiar." -> You waste some time but do the right thing. Add +1 to the floor turn counter, but Sayaka gains the **Team Player** passive for the next 3 battles.
    *   **Option B:** "Convince her it's not worth the risk." -> Sayaka reluctantly agrees, but her Soul Gem grows noticeably dimmer. She suffers a -5% `spr` debuff for the rest of the run.

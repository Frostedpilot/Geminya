### **Series: Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?**

A slice-of-life romantic comedy that blurs the lines between the online world of the MMORPG "Legendary Age" and the real lives of the "Alley Cats" guild members. Their dynamic revolves around teamwork in-game and navigating awkward social situations offline, heavily influenced by their quirky personalities and Ako's inability to separate game from reality.

**Series-wise Skills:**

1.  **Alley Cats Assemble!**
    *   **Description:** The members of the Alley Cats guild coordinate a signature pincer attack, just like in the game "Legendary Age."
    *   **Target:** All enemies.
    *   **Effect Breakdown:** Each living "Netoge no Yome" ally on the team (up to 4) performs a basic attack on a random enemy. Each attack deals 75% of its normal damage. If all four main members (Hideki, Ako, Akane, Kyou) are present, each attack has a 20% chance to reduce the target's `vit` by 10% for 2 turns.
    *   **Acquisition:** Acquired through a specific series event during a run.

2.  **For the Love of the Game**

    *   **Target:** All allies.
    *   **Effect Breakdown:** Grants all allies +20% to a random stat (`atk`, `mag`, `vit`, or `spd`) for 3 turns. However, all allies also receive -10% to another, different random stat for 1 turn.
    *   **Acquisition:** Acquired through a specific series event during a run.

**Series-wise Passives:**

1.  **Offline Meeting**

    *   **Option A:** "Let's do this!" -> You face a challenging boss battle. If you win, you receive a rare equipment piece, "Alley Cats' Emblem." If you lose, the party is demoralized and starts the next battle with -15% to all stats for 2 turns.
    *   **Option B:** "We're not ready for this." -> You avoid the risky battle, and nothing changes.

2.  **Ako's Reality Quest**
    *   **Description:** Ako has mistaken a simple errand for an epic quest. She's trying to "grind" for ingredients by picking weeds and talking to "NPCs" (confused strangers). Hideki looks exhausted.
    *   **Option A:** "Play along with her quest." -> Ako is overjoyed, feeling her party supports her. She gains +15 permanent `mag` for the run. The party loses some time, adding +1 to the floor's turn counter.
    *   **Option B:** "Gently explain it's not a game." -> Ako is momentarily sad but understands. She gains +15 permanent `int` for the run.

3.  **Pay-to-Win Temptation**
    *   **Description:** Kyou Goshouin pulls out her credit card, suggesting the guild can overcome the next challenge by simply buying a hoard of powerful cash-shop items. Akane is appalled by the idea.
    *   **Option A:** "Accept Kyou's generous offer." -> The party gains three random high-tier consumable items. However, Akane Segawa is annoyed and starts the next battle with the 'Frustrated' status (-10% `atk`).
    *   **Option B:** "Insist on winning with skill." -> Akane is proud of the team's integrity. She gains a permanent +5% `atk` and `vit` for the run. Kyou Goshouin pouts, starting the next battle with -10% `mag`.

4.  **Husband and Wife's Quarrel (Co-op Event: Ako & Hideki)**
    *   **Description:** Ako is angry at Hideki for healing another female party member before her in the last battle. "A husband should always prioritize his wife!" she yells. Hideki tries to explain game mechanics, but she won't listen.
    *   **Option A:** "Tell Hideki to apologize to his wife." -> Hideki sighs and apologizes. Ako is happy, and her next heal is a guaranteed critical heal. Hideki gains the **Aggressor** passive for the next battle.
    *   **Option B:** "Defend Hideki's tactical decision." -> Ako is furious and refuses to heal Hideki for the next battle unless his HP drops below 30%. Hideki is relieved, gaining +15 `spr` for the next 3 battles.

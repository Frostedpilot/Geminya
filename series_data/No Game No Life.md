### **Series: No Game No Life**

**Series-wise Skills:**

1.  **Pledge Taker**
    *   **Description:** The user invokes the Ten Pledges, forcing a high-stakes, one-on-one challenge. The winner takes all.
    *   **Target:** The user and the enemy with the highest combined `atk` and `mag`.
    *   **Effect Breakdown:** Both the user and the target are dealt 50% of their max HP as neutral damage. If the user survives and the target is defeated by this damage, the user gains a permanent +15% to all stats for the rest of the battle. If the user is defeated by this skill, all allies receive a -20% `vit` and `spr` debuff for 3 turns. This skill can only be used once per battle.
    *   **Acquisition:** Acquired through a specific series event during a run.

2.  **Cheating Detected**
    *   **Description:** The user exposes an opponent's "cheat," turning their own strength against them and nullifying their advantages.
    *   **Target:** The enemy with the most active buffs.
    *   **Effect Breakdown:** Removes all buffs from the target. For each buff removed, the target takes 40% of the user's `int` as neutral damage and has their action bar reduced by 10%.
    *   **Acquisition:** Acquired through a specific series event during a run.

**Series-wise Passives:**

1.  **『 』(Blank)**
    *   **Description:** The combined presence of the undefeated gamer siblings, Sora and Shiro, creates an unbeatable synergy.
    *   **Effect:** This passive is active if both Shiro and a character with the "Sora's Presence" passive (granted by a specific event or item) are on the team. All "No Game No Life" allies have their `int` and `lck` increased by 20%. Additionally, at the start of each turn, there is a 10% chance to reveal one of the enemy's skills, showing its target and effect before it is used.
    *   **Acquisition:** Active as long as both Shiro and a character with "Sora's Presence" are in the active party.

2.  **Aschente (Pledge Agreement)**
    *   **Description:** The rules of the game are absolute. At the start of combat, both sides must agree to the terms.
    *   **Effect:** At the start of battle, the `spd` of the fastest ally and the fastest enemy are averaged, and both are set to that new value for 3 turns. This prevents an initial speed-blitz from either side.
    *   **Acquisition:** Acquired through a specific series event during a run.

**Series-wise Items:**

1.  **Imanity's Piece**
    *   **Type:** Consumable
    *   **Description:** A chess piece representing the last hope of Imanity. Using it inspires a desperate will to win.
    *   **Effect:** Use before a battle. For the next 3 turns of combat, all "No Game No Life" allies gain the **Last Stand** passive (When HP drops below 30%, gain +25% `atk` and `mag`).

2.  **Bottle of Spirit-Water**
    *   **Type:** Consumable
    *   **Description:** A bottle of enchanted water from the Elven capital. It's known for its potent restorative properties.
    *   **Effect:** Use outside of battle. Restores 40% HP to all allies and removes all non-unique debuffs.

**Series-wise Events:**

1.  **A Game of... Rock-Paper-Scissors?**
    *   **Description:** You encounter a mysterious cloaked figure who challenges your party to a "simple" game of rock-paper-scissors to pass. However, they declare, "As per the Pledges, you must wager something of value." Shiro looks on with intense focus, analyzing the opponent's minute twitches.
    *   **Option A:** "Wager some of our resources." -> You lose a significant amount of currency, but Shiro reads the opponent perfectly. You win the game and receive a rare piece of equipment.
    *   **Option B:** "Wager a fraction of our strength." -> You play the game. Win or lose, the party is drained by the pledge. All allies start the next battle with -15% max HP.
    *   **Option C:** (Requires Shiro) "Let Shiro handle this." -> Shiro declares, "Rock-Paper-Scissors is a flawed game." She proposes a different game of pure logic. The opponent, flustered, forfeits. The party gains the "Aschente" series passive for the rest of the run.

2.  **The Werebeast's Arcade**
    *   **Description:** Izuna and a group of Werebeasts have set up a surprisingly high-tech arcade in the middle of a dungeon. She challenges you to a rhythm game, "desu!" The stakes are high; if you win, you get their treasure. If you lose, you have to wear fluffy animal ears for the rest of the floor.
    *   **Option A:** "Accept the challenge!" -> You give it your all. Your entire team gains +10% `spd` for the next 3 battles. There is a 50% chance they are also afflicted with 'Embarrassment' (a purely cosmetic effect of wearing animal ears).
    *   **Option B:** "Decline politely." -> Izuna pouts but respects your decision. You move on, but miss out on the potential rewards.

3.  **Jibril's Library**
    *   **Description:** You stumble upon a massive, otherworldly library. Jibril is inside, casually reading a book that emanates immense power. She offers to share some of her knowledge with one of your party members, but the price is steep: a portion of their very essence.
    *   **Option A:** "Allow a magic-user to learn from her." -> Choose a Mage or Healer ally. They permanently gain +20 `mag` and `int` for the run, but their max HP is permanently reduced by 15%.
    *   **Option B:** "Allow a physical fighter to learn." -> Choose an Attacker or Defender ally. They permanently gain +20 `atk` and `vit`, but their max HP is permanently reduced by 15%.
    *   **Option C:** "It's not worth the risk." -> You leave the library, your party intact but no more powerful than before.

4.  **Stephanie's Political Woes (Co-op Event: Shiro & Jibril)**
    *   **Description:** Stephanie Dola is overwhelmed with paperwork related to Imanity's foreign policy. Jibril suggests a complex, almost cruel, game to "motivate" the other politicians, while Shiro proposes a simple but elegant system to streamline the work.
    *   **Option A:** "Go with Jibril's game." -> Jibril gains +10 permanent `mag`. The party gains a large amount of currency, but Stephanie is stressed, suffering -10% `spr` for the next battle.

2.  **Flügel's Halo**
    *   **Type:** Accessory
    *   **Description:** A shimmering, ethereal halo that crackles with magical energy. A trophy from a long-forgotten battle.
    *   **Effect (Passive):** Grants the **Magic Up II** passive (+20% base `mag`). If equipped by Jibril, her single-target skills have a 20% chance to ignore 50% of the target's `spr`.

1.  **Art Supplies Shortage**
    *   **Description:** Misaki has run out of her favorite brand of ink and is in a creative slump. The only place that sells it is in a town heavily patrolled by the Public Morals Committee.
    *   **Option A:** "Risk it for the ink." -> You sneak into town and manage to get the supplies. The thrill of the mission invigorates her. Misaki permanently gains the **Evasion** passive for this run.
    *   **Option B:** "Tell her to use a different brand." -> She tries, but the results are subpar, leaving her dejected. Misaki starts the next battle with -15% `mag` and `lck` for 3 turns.

2.  **A Prank Gone Wrong... or Right?**
    *   **Description:** Misaki decides to play a prank by swapping the team's drink canteens with water that has a harmless, temporary color-changing dye. Asane, not amused, is about to explode.
    *   **Option A:** "Stop Asane from retaliating." -> You prevent a fight, but Asane is furious with you both. Asane and Misaki start the next battle with the 'Anxiety' debuff for 1 turn.
    *   **Option B:** "Let the chaos unfold." -> Asane chases Misaki around camp. The ridiculous sight of everyone with rainbow-colored tongues surprisingly boosts morale. The entire party gains +15% `lck` for the next 3 battles.

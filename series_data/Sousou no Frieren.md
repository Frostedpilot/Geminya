4.  **The Cursed Grimoire**
    *   **Description:** In a dusty ruin, Übel finds a grimoire bound in human skin, emanating a palpable aura of dark magic. She is fascinated by it. Serie would likely destroy it on sight, but Frieren seems merely curious.

1.  **The Scales of Obedience**

On success, Aura dominates the golem, which joins you as a temporary, uncontrollable tank for the next 2 battles.

    *   **Option B:** "Tell her it's not worth the effort." -> Aura scoffs at your cowardice. "You would let such a fine prize go to waste?" She refuses to fight, forcing the rest of the party to handle the next battle with one fewer member (Aura does not participate).

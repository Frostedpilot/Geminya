    *   **Option B:** "Create a distraction and dispose of it." -> Requires a `lck` check (60+). On success, you get away with it and find a valuable item in the trash. On failure, Yor catches you. The party starts the next battle with a -20% `spr` debuff for 3 turns due to the crushing guilt.

    *   **Requirement:** Have Loid Forger and Yor Forger on your active team.
    *   **Option A:** "A simple, sweet hand-holding." -> The display is convincing enough. The neighbor leaves. Loid and Yor both gain the **Soothing Presence** passive for the next 3 battles.
    *   **Option B:** "A dramatic, passionate kiss." -> Loid's expertise and Yor's flustered panic create a bizarrely convincing scene. Both characters gain a permanent +5% HP for the run, but start the next battle 'Dazed' for 1 turn from the emotional whiplash.

**NOTE:** The provided stats and archetype for Sylvia Sherwood ("Sentinel" with high `vit`/`spr`) seem to conflict with her established character as a non-combatant intelligence handler. I have designed her skills to fit a "defensive support" role that aligns with these stats, interpreting her role as one who protects the mission's integrity. Would you like to reconsider her stats and archetype to better fit an `int`-based Buffer/Debuffer role?

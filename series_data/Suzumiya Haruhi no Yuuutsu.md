2.  **A Glimpse of the Future**
    *   **Description:** Mikuru trips, and a small, complex-looking device falls from her pocket. She snatches it up, stammering, "That's classified information!" before you can get a good look.
    *   **Option A:** "Don't press the issue." -> Respecting her mission is the right call. The party is blessed with good fortune. All allies start the next battle with +20% `lck`.
    *   **Option B:** "Ask what the device does." -> She panics and refuses to answer. The timeline is slightly altered by your curiosity. The turn order for all units in the next battle is completely randomized.
